# Web2 entry-token funding — the ONE audience the funds wall still sends to an
# ENTRY TOKEN (the Buy an Entry Token modal: Coinflow buy-1 on top, the Stripe pack
# picker below) rather than to the Get USDC card.
#
# THAT AUDIENCE IS NOT "web2", and an earlier version of this header said it was.
# showFundsNeeded stopped forking on session.mode on 2026-09-05: the answer at the
# funds wall is Get USDC for everyone EXCEPT the USDC kill-switch audience (a web2
# viewer with ENABLE_WEB2_USDC_ENTRY off), who literally cannot pay an entry with
# USDC. Top Up Wallet is not on either branch — see the note above the dispatcher
# tests below.
#
# The split is a single client dispatcher, selectionBoard#showFundsNeeded, that
# every funds-needed reroute (the no_funding blocker, the hold-window check, the
# chain-layer "no entry token" twin) funnels through. These assert the wiring at
# the render boundary — the modal registration, both rails, and the dispatcher. The
# live Alpine handoff is a tracked Playwright e2e gap (same precedent as
# wallet_topup_test + the on-chain success modal). Companion to
# wallet_topup_test.rb.

  # --- WHY NOTHING HERE ASSERTS A ROUTE INTO TOP UP WALLET ---------------------
  #
  # A test named "Top Up Wallet is still REACHABLE, not merely still defined" used
  # to sit here, and it was WORSE than no test. It asserted, against the whole
  # contest page:
  #
  #     $store.modals.swap('wallet-topup', {})   # "the Get USDC card must carry
  #                                              #  the onward control into Top Up
  #                                              #  Wallet"
  #     "Buy USDC with Coinbase"
  #
  # NEITHER STRING COMES FROM THE GET USDC CARD. The swap() literal is rendered by
  # modals/_onramp_hub (its Back link) and the Coinbase title by
  # modals/_wallet_topup, and the layout registers BOTH ungated into every contest
  # page — so these held whatever the card did. It also asserted
  # `showWalletTopup() {` and the layout's own `current().id === 'wallet-topup'`,
  # which are the board script and the layout answering for a third file again.
  #
  # Measured three ways, 2026-09-07:
  #
  #   · commit 6e4d73cd ADDED that control to the card (as its :198 "More ways to
  #     add funds" button) and b792cd32 REMOVED it. Every assertion in this test
  #     was byte-identical and green across both.
  #   · replacing modals/_buy_usdc.html.erb with an empty <div> — the entire card
  #     deleted — left this file and wallet_topup_test.rb at 26 runs, 170
  #     assertions, 0 failures.
  #   · re-adding the control failed test/views/buy_usdc_modal_test.rb at its
  #     wallet-topup refutation, and moved nothing here.
  #
  # AND THE FAILURE MESSAGE POINTED THE WRONG WAY, which is the part that made it
  # urgent rather than merely useless. The CDP/Coinbase onramp has NO LEGAL
  # CLEARANCE (operator, 2026-09-06), so the card deliberately carries no route to
  # it — direct or one hop away through Top Up Wallet. Had this ever gone red it
  # would have instructed the next builder to restore exactly that route.
  #
  # WHERE THE COVERAGE ACTUALLY LIVES, and it is the opposite assertion:
  #   · test/views/buy_usdc_modal_test.rb, "the card offers Phantom and NOTHING
  #     resembling a payment rail" — renders the PARTIAL alone (so the layout's
  #     other modals cannot answer for it) and refutes cdp-ramp, wallet-topup,
  #     onramp-hub and "Coinbase". That guard is what fails if the link returns.
  #   · the dispatcher tests above pin the route that IS live: showFundsNeeded ->
  #     showGetUsdc.
  #   · wallet_topup_test.rb pins that the wallet-topup modal is still registered.
  #
  # showWalletTopup itself now has ZERO callers. That orphan is a known, escalated
  # loose end (see the closing comment in modals/_buy_usdc.html.erb): what to do
  # with Top Up Wallet and the Add Funds hub while the onramp is uncleared is an
  # operator decision about those surfaces, not something a test may quietly
  # decide by demanding a link back.

  # --- the empty-rails guard, with its FALSE branch actually run --------------
  #
  # Review found this guard had never executed. entryTokenRailsAvailable mirrors
  # the only two rails _buy_entry_token renders, but onramp_helper.rb opens
  # `return true unless Rails.env.production?`, so outside production every rail
  # is visible and the flag can only ever be true. The assertion that existed was
  # an assert_includes of the literal `if` line — it proved the branch was WRITTEN,
  # not that it works.
  #
  # Fake production the way the onramp helper's own tests do, turn both rails off,
  # and read the server's answer out of the payload the board branches on.
  # (The JS branch itself still wants an e2e; this closes the server half, which
  # is the half that decides.)
