# Web2 entry-token funding — a web2 / managed player who lacks funds at the entry
# blocker now buys an ENTRY TOKEN (the Buy an Entry Token modal: Coinflow buy-1 on
# top, the Stripe pack picker below) instead of the USDC Top Up Wallet. Web3 wallet
# players are UNCHANGED (still the Coinbase-forward USDC Top Up Wallet).
#
# The audience split is a single client dispatcher, selectionBoard#showFundsNeeded,
# that every funds-needed reroute (the no_funding blocker, the hold-window check,
# the chain-layer "no entry token" twin) funnels through. These assert the wiring
# at the render boundary — the modal registration, both rails, the dispatcher, and
# that web3's showWalletTopup path is intact. The live Alpine handoff is a tracked
# Playwright e2e gap (same precedent as wallet_topup_test + the on-chain success
# modal). Companion to wallet_topup_test.rb.
