# [integration] Turf Monster's emails after adopting the shared engine manager.
#
# The app used to carry two half-managers: ::EmailCatalog + Admin::EmailsController
# (all 8 emails, typed, previewable, no banner management) and the engine's
# /admin/email_images (one email, its banner, nothing else). Both are gone. This
# asserts what replaced them — one page, at /admin/emails, that does both — and
# the two things that could silently regress in real email while every page still
# looks fine.

  # --- what actually ships in the inbox --------------------------------------

  # The banner is registered as a default_asset pointing at THIS APP's committed
  # artwork, so it must resolve through turf-monster's own asset pipeline — not
  # the engine's. If default_asset only ever resolved gem assets, every one of
  # these emails would silently lose its banner.

  # BACK TO THE FLAT <img>, and this comment has now swung twice — worth saying
  # plainly rather than quietly rewriting again. It first asserted
  # "magic-link-banner"; 2026-08-13 moved it to the layered background because
  # the email had genuinely changed shape; 2026-09-07 moved it back, because
  # Mr. McRitchie asked for July's artwork and that artwork carries its own
  # words. The lesson the middle version claimed — that structure beats a
  # filename — still holds, so this pins the STRUCTURE in both directions: the
  # flat image is present AND the layered markup is gone. Asserting only the
  # filename would pass just as happily with a layered banner underneath it.
