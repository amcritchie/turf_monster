# The World Cup rulebook (turf-totals-v1) published a "Per-Game Lock" section
# promising that "each selection locks when its specific game kicks off — not
# all at once" and that a player "can change or swap picks for games that
# haven't started yet, even after confirming your entry".
#
# Entry refuses all of it. The H7 prelaunch audit (2026-05-24, entry.rb's
# assert_enterable! comment) closed exactly that behaviour as the
# staggered-kickoff information-edge attack: wait past the contest's stated
# lock, read live scores from games that already kicked off, then submit picks
# drawn from later-kickoff matchups whose own `locked?` is still false. The
# page documented the exploit as a feature for roughly three and a half months,
# on a real-money page every funnel visitor lands on.
#
# So this guard does NOT grep for a replacement sentence — that rots at the
# next reword. It MEASURES what Entry enforces against a staggered slate, then
# requires the published copy to agree with the measurement. If someone ever
# reintroduces per-game locking in the model, the measurement flips and this
# test demands the page be changed back. If someone rewrites the page toward
# the old promise, the copy assertions fail against the unchanged code.
#
# SCOPE, since the filename undersells it: this file measures Contest and Entry,
# which never branch on sport, then holds EVERY published lock surface to that
# one measurement — the World Cup rulebook, the NFL rulebook, the Terms editing
# clause, and the funnel helper's citation trail. Add a lock surface, add it
# here; do not stand up a second fixture, or the surfaces gain a way to disagree
# with each other about the same code.

  # ── the LOCK MOMENT, measured against the slate's first kickoff ───────────
  # Every lock surface this file guards once named the lock as "the first
  # kickoff on the slate", and three assertions above REQUIRED that phrase. It
  # is not a synonym for the lock moment. Contest#locks_at is `starts_at ||
  # slate.first_game_starts_at || slate.starts_at` (contest.rb:686-693): an
  # explicit starts_at WINS, it is admin-permitted on create AND edit
  # (contests_controller.rb:2702, 2737), and NOTHING validates it against the
  # slate. The two moments coincide only when an admin leaves starts_at blank —
  # and measured against production on 2026-09-07, all 7 contests set it by hand.
  #
  # WHY THIS REPLACED A GREP, because the old assertion looked harmless. It read
  # `assert_match(/first kickoff/i, lock_text)` against the lock-rules subtree,
  # and the PROSE in that subtree has said "at its stated start time" since
  # 2026-09-07 — so it passed only because the WORKED EXAMPLE nested in the same
  # subtree still supplied the phrase. A guard everyone read as pinning the
  # prose was load-bearing on an example nobody thought was load-bearing:
  # rewording the example alone turned it red, with a message about the prose.
  #
  # MEASURED, NOT ASSERTED, which is what keeps both directions live. If Contest
  # ever derives or validates starts_at against the slate's first kickoff,
  # admin_scheduled_contest's lock MOVES to @early_kickoff, this reads false,
  # and every surface below flips to demanding the kickoff wording BACK — the

  # ones a player actually reads, and both made the SAME promise in plainer
  # words: "you can swap any of your six teams as often as you like" until the
  # contest locks. Unqualified, that covers a team whose own match is already
  # underway — precisely the swap pre_lock_pick_freeze proves Entry refuses.

  # They CONSUME the measurement above rather than restating it. Contest#locks_at
  # and SlateMatchup#locked? never branch on sport, so the one fifa-slate
  # measurement certifies the NFL rulebook too; a second fixture would only give
  # the two pages a way to disagree about the same code.
  #
  # BOTH BRANCHES ARE LIVE, and that is the point of measuring instead of
  # grepping. If Contest ever derives or validates starts_at against the slate's
  # first kickoff, the asymmetry vanishes, `frozen` goes false, and the qualifier
  # becomes a caveat that can never operate — a restriction the page claims and
  # the code no longer applies. The else branch then demands it come back OUT.
