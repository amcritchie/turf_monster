# OPSEC — the browser must never receive a CREDENTIAL-BEARING RPC URL.
#
# THE BUG (pre-existing; surfaced in the Carl+Jasper review of
# require-solana-rpc-in-production). Six browser-facing surfaces emitted
# `Solana::Config::RPC_URL` — the SERVER's RPC endpoint — verbatim into the
# response body:
#
#   app/views/layouts/application.html.erb      body[data-solana-rpc-url]
#   app/views/layouts/modal_preview.html.erb    body[data-solana-rpc-url]
#   app/views/admin/pending_transactions/…      #cosign-config[data-rpc-url]
#   app/controllers/admin/vault_state_controller.rb   -> @rpc_url -> same div
#   app/controllers/admin/vault_init_controller.rb    -> @rpc_url -> same div
#   app/controllers/proof_of_reserves_controller.rb   -> @page_config[:rpc_url]
#
# On the mainnet app that constant is a paid provider endpoint carrying an
# `api-key` query param, so every page load shipped a provider credential to
# every browser — and proof-of-reserves is UNAUTHENTICATED and additionally
# renders the value as visible page text. The tell that the codebase already
# knew: lib/tasks/solana.rake and lib/tasks/solana_preflight.rake both redact
# `api-key=…` before printing the same constant to a TERMINAL.
#
# HOW THIS TEST WORKS. The real secret is never written down anywhere. The
# suite substitutes a provider-SHAPED but entirely fake endpoint for
# Solana::Config::RPC_URL, then asserts on a REDACTION PREDICATE
# (`Solana::Config.credentialed_rpc_url?`) rather than on the literal — the
# invariant is "nothing credentialed reaches the DOM", which has to hold for a
# key nobody typed into this file. SENTINEL_ABSENT is the belt to that braces.
class RpcCredentialNotInBrowserTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  # Deliberately fake. Its only job is to be conspicuous if it escapes.

  # RPC_URL is a LOAD-TIME constant (deliberately — see the OPSEC-012 comment
  # in config.rb, and the constant-form pin in config_rpc_required_test.rb), so
  # swapping the constant is the only way to put a credentialed value on the
  # server side. Rails parallelizes by FORK, so this never crosses workers.

  # One assertion shared by every surface.
  #   1. the fake credential is nowhere in the response, and

  # (2) is what keeps this honest: deleting the attribute entirely would
  # satisfy (1) while breaking every client-side transaction.

  # --- the three admin cosign surfaces ---

  # This surface no longer hands the browser an RPC URL AT ALL, and that is a
  # deliberate strengthening rather than a way around assert_browser_rpc_clean.
  #
  # Read clause (2) of that helper first: it refuses a surface that emits
  # nothing, because "deleting the attribute entirely would satisfy (1) while
  # breaking every client-side transaction." That reasoning is exactly right for
  # the other five surfaces, which still build and send transactions in the
  # browser. It stopped applying HERE on 2026-09-05, when the cosign page handed
  # its broadcast to the server (Admin::PendingTransactionsController#broadcast
  # → Solana::Vault#simulate_and_broadcast). This page's browser now signs with
  # Phantom and POSTs the wire back; it never opens a Connection, so there is no
  # client RPC path left to break.
  #
  # So the invariant tightens instead of loosening: a URL that is never emitted
  # cannot carry a credential. Asserting the ABSENCE is what pins the new
  # architecture — if someone reintroduces a browser-side broadcast here, they
  # have to reintroduce the RPC handle, and this test fails and sends them back
  # to read why it went away.
  #
  # The sentinel check is kept verbatim: it is the original security property
  # and it must hold no matter how the page is built.
