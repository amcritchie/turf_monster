# Regression — chore: adopt studio-engine 0.20 modal blocks (adopt-engine-twenty-defork).
#
# TM stopped forking the generic modal blocks and now renders studio-engine's
# studio/modals/... partials: card_header, cta_redirect, progress_pill, shell,
# the five modal templates, the shared email_field (with the live validator),
# the free_entry_earned celebration block, and the wallet-brand sprite in the
# Connect-Wallet picker.
#
# 2026-08-25 (adopt-engine-solana-blocks): two thirds of the Solana success
# cluster followed. onchain_success and solana_tx_link were byte-identical to
# the engine blocks in RENDERED markup, so TM's copies are deleted. Still forked:
# entry_confirmed (kickoff countdown + $store.solanaModal drive).
#
# 2026-08-28 (defork-turf-modal-host): the modal HOST left this list. It was the
# last structural fork — app/views/studio/modals/_host.html.erb, 518 lines
# SHADOWING the engine's host, carrying an inline cosign-rejected registration
# and a per-modal card-width map. Both moved onto studio-engine 0.65.0's seams
# (window.StudioModals.CARD_WIDTHS via app/views/shared/_modal_card_widths, and
# app/views/modals/_host_extras) and the fork is deleted.
#
# ITS RE-FORK GUARD IS NOT THE `deleted` LIST BELOW. That list matches deleted
# RENDER CALLS, and `render "studio/modals/host"` is a call this app still makes
# and must keep making — the engine owns the file now. A re-fork of the host is a
# FILE reappearing at the shadow path, which nothing on a page can see. It is
# pinned by resolution in test/views/modal_host_adoption_test.rb instead.
#
# These assert the swap at the render boundary — the ENGINE partials render,
# the removed forks are gone, and the kept Solana forks still resolve their
# now-adopted card_header dependency (the "kept fork renders an adopted block"
# seam that would crash the success card AFTER a live on-chain entry).
