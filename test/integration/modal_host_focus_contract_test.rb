# [integration] The modal host THIS APP RENDERS must carry the engine's focus
# contract.
#
# THE PREMISE INVERTED ON 2026-08-28 (defork-turf-modal-host), and the tests did
# not have to change with it. This file used to open "This app's FORK of the
# modal host…": the app shipped its own app/views/studio/modals/_host.html.erb,
# studio-engine is NON-ISOLATED so that view SHADOWED the engine's, the engine's
# file was never rendered here, and every engine focus fix had to be ported by
# hand. The fork is deleted; the engine's host renders.
#
# WHY THIS FILE STAYS, rather than deferring to the engine's own suite. What the
# engine covers is the engine's file. What this app's users get is whichever host
# RESOLVES here, and two things can still change that answer without touching a
# line of the engine: a new app view at the same path re-creates the shadow, and
# the studio-engine pin admits a RANGE, so a resolve inside it can carry a host
# that predates a fix. (The pin's version is deliberately not named — this line
# used to say `~> 0.64`, a pin PR #581 deleted, and the argument turns on the
# range rather than on the number. test/lib/engine_pin_contract_test.rb owns the
# current floor and asserts it.) Both are silent —
# the page still renders a modal either way. So the assertions below read the
# RESOLVED host (ResolvedModalHost, test/support), which is the same file a page
# actually gets, and they hold whichever repo it came from.
#
# NEVER re-point this at a hardcoded path — not the app's, and not the gem's. A
# gem path asserts how the engine HAPPENS to be installed and cannot pass in
# studio-engine's own consumer-CI lane, which bundles it as a path checkout.
class ModalHostFocusContractTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  def host_source = ResolvedModalHost.source

  # THE BACKDROP ELEMENT, parsed out of the RENDERED page.
  #
  # WHY NOT assert_includes ON THE SOURCE — this is the trap the first version of
  # this file fell into, caught by mutation in review. `assert_includes src,
  # "captureFocus"` is a bare substring, and this host DOCUMENTS captureFocus in its
  # own JS comments. Deleting the x-init BINDING left it green. So did deleting the
  # whole captureFocus function. And because those are `//` comments inside <script>,
  # they are emitted into the rendered HTML too — which defeated the "RENDERED, not
  # just source" test written to guard exactly this trap.
  #
  # An attribute on a parsed ELEMENT cannot be satisfied by prose. That is the whole
  # reason for the parser.
  #
  # NOKOGIRI::HTML5, NOT NOKOGIRI::HTML. libxml2 silently DROPS every Alpine event
  # attribute. Measured on this page: the libxml2 parse of this backdrop returns 9
  # attributes, the HTML5 parse returns 11, and the two it loses are
  # @keydown.tab.prevent (the entire tab trap) and @click.self (click-outside
  # dismissal) — it also mangles @keydown.escape.window into a bare `false`
  # attribute. A test on Nokogiri::HTML would report the trap missing, and the
  # tempting next move is to stop asserting it.

  # attribute still reads "$store.modals.captureFocus($el)" — it just points at
  # nothing, and Alpine throws at runtime where no Rails test is looking.

  # covered the day it is added. Anchored on the DEFINITION form (`name: function(`),
  # which prose cannot satisfy — the whole reason the substring version failed.

  # THE FOURTH ENGINE FIX, which the deleted fork missed entirely. The backdrop centres the

  # BOTH edges with nothing scrollable and its actions unreachable — and on a

  # out at all. It arrived in the engine in the SAME commit as captureFocus.
