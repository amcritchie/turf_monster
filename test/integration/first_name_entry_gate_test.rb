# The first name as the FIRST validation of hold-to-confirm (operator call,
# 2026-08-15). Before this, a player could hold their way to the age gate, the
# wallet gate and the funding wall with the name still blank — the onboarding
# chain asked once and let a skip stand.
#
# What this tier owns, in the order the pieces have to line up:
#   1. the server publishes firstNameRequired on the session payload, derived
#      from the COLUMN (a session skip must not buy anyone past a validation);
#   2. eligibilityBlocker returns first_name_required AHEAD of age, wallet and
#      funding;
#   3. the board dispatches that reason to the required-mode card and resumes
#      the entry only when IT opened the card;
#   4. the card in required mode offers no way to skip.
#
# NOT owned here, deliberately: a server-side refusal. A first name is how we
# address someone in an email, not a compliance or capability property, so
# ContestsController#enter still accepts an entry without one — unlike the age
# and wallet gates, whose server twins exist because an entry past them is
# illegal or unsignable. e2e/onboarding_chain.spec.js proves the live ordering.

    # detail the gem never promised.

  # --- 4. the resume shim, which did NOT graduate into the gem -----------------

  # turf's deleted card cleared $store.session.firstNameRequired and dispatched

  # both outcomes and distinguishes them with detail.saved, so the branch moved
  # into the layout's chain driver.
  #

  # SOURCE TEXT: they prove the branch shipped, not that it behaves.
  #
  # This note NAMED THE WRONG MUTANT until 2026-09-07, and the correction makes
  # the point sharper rather than softer. It claimed a negated condition —
  # `if (e && e.detail && !e.detail.saved)` — slips past; it does not, because
  # the assert_includes below pins that literal character-for-character and the
  # `!` breaks it. The mutant that really survives this whole Ruby tier (measured:
  # 26 runs, 213 assertions, 0 failures) keeps EVERY literal intact and simply
  # moves the `window.dispatchEvent` line OUT of the `if` — so every string this
  # file looks for is still present, in order, while a skip resumes an entry whose
  # user still has no name. A source-text tier cannot see a statement that MOVED.
  # The behavioural half is
  # e2e/onboarding_chain.spec.js's "the entry resume fires on a save and not on
  # a skip", which drives the real listener in a real browser.
