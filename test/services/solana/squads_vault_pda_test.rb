# Unit half of admin-shows-devnet-authority. The integration suite
# (test/integration/contract_upgrade_authority_test.rb) proves the admin
# deployment-state card RENDERS the right authority on each cluster; this
# proves the PRIMITIVE that card calls.
#
# THE BUG. `app/views/contract/_section_admin_state.html.erb` hardcoded the
# DEVNET Squads vault PDA into markup, so `turf-monster-mainnet` presented the
# devnet Squad as the live program upgrade authority — under a caption reading
# "Only the Squad can ship upgrades."
#
# CORRECTION (vault-pda-readers-diverge). This header used to add "every other
# reader of that value already honoured SOLANA_SQUADS_VAULT_PDA; the view could
# not follow it." That was false. Admin::VaultInitController and
# `solana:init_vault` both fell back to the DEVNET literal on EVERY cluster,
# and the controller read the variable with `ENV.fetch`, which takes its
# default only when the key is absent — not when it is empty. The key IS absent
# on both deployed apps, so that fallback is what ran and all three readers had
# the SAME live symptom: the devnet Squad on the mainnet app. Both now route
# through Solana::Config.squads_vault_pda; the view was simply the only copy a
# human could see.

  # --- three ways to say "no value", kept apart on purpose ---
  #
  # UNSET, EMPTY and WHITESPACE-ONLY are three distinct states, and Ruby treats

  # while `ENV[k].presence` collapses all three.
  #
  # UNSET is the live production state — the key is ABSENT on both deployed
  # apps — so it is the case that actually runs, and it is the one an
  # `ENV.fetch` reader resolves correctly. EMPTY is what
  # `heroku config:set VAR=` would create; no deployed app is in it, and it is
  # the case an `ENV.fetch` reader would get wrong. Both are worth pinning: one
  # is what production does, the other is one config:set away and is the reason
  # the reader uses `.presence`.
  #
  # Asserting them together in a single test would let two pass on the strength
  # of the third, so they get one test each.
