# (the four-key allowlist) lives in the controller and is tested in
# test/controllers/solana_client_failure_report_test.rb; everything here is layer
# 2 — the by-VALUE rules, which exist because `raw_message` is free text the app
# does not compose and the key allowlist can say nothing about what is inside it.

  # rule is that a wallet can quote THIS back at us in an error, and a test built
  # on a paraphrase would certify a redactor against a string the app never emits
  # (the mistake app/javascript/debug_logger.js's own comment records making).
