# Unit — Tokens::LevelUpGrant is the payout behind the level-up modal's Free
# Entry Token. (This note used to quote the card's "is minting now" sentence;
# the 2026-09-07 copy polish removed it. The MINT is still asynchronous — only
# the sentence announcing it is gone.) What it must get right:
#   - one token per level milestone, lowest level first
#   - a DETERMINISTIC source_ref, because that is the ONLY thing standing
#     between a Sidekiq retry and a double-grant
#   - never paying over an operator's manual /admin/free_entries mint
#   - never advancing its waterline past a level that was not actually minted
