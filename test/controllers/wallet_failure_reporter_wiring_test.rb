# The seams between the three artifacts that make client-failure reporting work:
# the JS reporter (app/javascript/solana_errors.js), the call site that invokes
# it (a modal's x-data), and the server that receives it.
#
# WHY THESE ASSERTIONS AND NOT "THE STRING IS PRESENT". Grepping rendered markup
# for `reportWalletFailure` proves the characters shipped and nothing else — the
# path could 404, the stage could be one the server has never heard of, and every
# such assertion would still pass. Each test below instead couples TWO artifacts
# and fails when either moves alone. Whether the behaviour actually works is the
# e2e tier's job (e2e/wallet_failure_report.spec.js), not this one's.

  # accounting is what stops a partial fix from reading as a complete one. A
  # half-corrected change leaves a contradiction more authoritative than the gap
  # it replaced; the fix is to say which half, out loud, in a place that is
  # checked. Follow-on work is tracked in docs/AUTH.md.
