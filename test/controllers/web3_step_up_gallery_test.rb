  # THE PARTIAL LIVES IN solana-studio NOW (2026-09-01). studio-engine lifted
  # this card out of this app on 2026-08-21, this app kept rendering a second copy
  # until 2026-08-24, and /tasks/turf-rides-gem-modals then moved the shared copy
  # on to solana-studio as `solana_studio/modals/_web3_step_up`. This app keeps
  # the guard rather than handing it entirely to the owning gem because THIS app
  # is what renders the card to a real player.
  #
  # RESOLVED, NOT PATH-JOINED. This used to read a fixed path into Studio::Engine.
  # A fixed path answers "what does that gem ship?", not "what does this app
  # render", and the two diverged the moment the card moved: studio-engine went on
  # shipping its copy until /tasks/drop-engine-web3-modals deleted it in 0.66.2, so
  # the old join would have kept PASSING against a partial this app no longer
  # renders, then died with ENOENT at that release rather than at the change that
  # broke it. This app runs above that floor, so studio-engine hands it neither the
  # card nor a studio/solana directory. Resolution stays the right instrument now
  # that only one copy is left, for a reason the window merely made obvious: it is
  # the only thing that answers "what does THIS APP render", and the next competing
  # copy will not announce itself either. See ResolvedWeb3StepUp.

  # Same failure mode the onboarding and wallet-setup modals each carry a guard
  # for: a double quote inside the double-quoted x-data closes the attribute
  # early and Alpine mounts the component as a SILENT no-op — the markup still
  # renders, so every assert_includes below still passes while the modal is dead
  # in a browser. It has bitten this codebase twice, so every new step-machine
  # modal gets this test.
