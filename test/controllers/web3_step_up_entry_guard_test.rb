# THE WEB2-SESSION HALF of ContestsController#enter's wallet guard.
#
# #enter is the WEB2 / managed server-signing path. Two shapes must never reach
# it, and until 2026-09-07 only ONE of them was refused:
#
#   web3 session          -> refused by the `onchain_session?` guard, which
#                            names prepare_entry as the path to be on.
#   web2 session, on an
#   account whose ONLY
#   wallet is self-custody -> NOT REFUSED. It fell all the way through to
#                            #resolve_web2_entry_funding!, which raised
#                            "Managed wallet missing keypair (cannot sign
#                            entry)" because there is no custodial address to
#                            sign with. The controller's own comment called that
#                            "an accident of another guard rather than a
#                            decision" and it was right.
#
# WHAT THE OPERATOR SAW (QA, 2026-09-07): fresh browser -> Enter Contest -> auth
# gate -> Google. The Google sign-in armed the web3 step-up card correctly, the
# board replayed the saved cart, and the entry raised — so a RED card titled
# "Submitting Entry" reading the raw exception text landed ON TOP of the
# step-up card that was already saying the right thing.
#
# THE GUARD IS DELIBERATELY NARROW, and both of its narrowing clauses have a
# test below that goes red if you drop them:
#   - it consults Web3StepUpPolicy rather than re-deriving the population, so
#     the entry path and the auth path cannot drift into two answers; and
#   - it fires only when there is NO custodial keypair to sign with. A COMBO
#     account (managed + linked wallet) owes an advisory step-up but can still
#     fund an entry from the wallet the server holds — #resolve_web2_entry_funding!
#     deliberately spends from the web2 address for exactly that account — and a
#     FREE contest signs nothing at all, so neither is refused.

  # The guard above is correct and, for the flow a player actually walks, was

  # to: beginFundingCheck() fires POST #check_funding the instant the hold
  # STARTS, and confirmEntry aborts into showFundsNeeded ("Get USDC") on a
  # definitive { fundable: false } without ever POSTing /enter. So the step-up
  # sat behind a door the player never got to knock on.
  #
  # WHAT THE OPERATOR SAW (qa.turfmonster.media, 2026-09-07): the navbar read
  # $31 while the entry gate opened Get USDC. Both numbers were honestly
  # produced — by two readers that resolve the wallet DIFFERENTLY:
  #
  #   navbar  User#solana_address        -> web3_solana_address || web2_...  (FALLS BACK)
  #   gate    #entry_funding_status      -> onchain_session? ? web3_... : web2_...  (NO fallback)
  #
  # On a wallet-only account whose session was never promoted (magic link,
  # email, or the Google collision) the gate resolves web2_solana_address = nil
  # and returns [false, nil] WITHOUT EVER READING A BALANCE — a money verdict
  # about an account whose money it never looked at. It is not devnet-specific
  # and reproduces on mainnet with real USDC.
  #
  # THE FIX IS NOT TO READ THE WEB3 WALLET HERE. Web2 entry SERVER-SIGNS from
  # web2_solana_address; pricing the entry off a wallet the server cannot sign
  # with would trade a false "Get USDC" for a doomed entry. The account owes a
