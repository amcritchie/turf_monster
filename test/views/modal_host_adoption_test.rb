# [component] Adoption of studio-engine's modal host, after this app stopped
# shadowing it with a 518-line fork of its own.
#
# WHAT WAS DELETED, and why it survived so long. studio-engine is a NON-ISOLATED
# Rails engine, so an app view at the same virtual path SHADOWS the engine's.
# This app had one at app/views/studio/modals/_host.html.erb. Both files rendered
# the same class names and the same store, so nothing on a page or in a markup
# assertion could tell the two apart — the duplication was invisible by
# construction, and the fork drifted behind the engine's focus and stale-entry
# guards for months while looking identical.
#
# THE FORK WAS THE RICH ONE, which is why this is a behaviour-preservation job
# and not a deletion. It carried two things the engine host did not: a per-modal
# card WIDTH map, and an app-wide registration for the cosign-rejected card.
# studio-engine 0.65.0 opened a seam for each, and this test pins that BOTH
# survived the move:
#
#   window.StudioModals.CARD_WIDTHS   app/views/shared/_modal_card_widths
#   modals/_host_extras               app/views/modals/_host_extras
#
# ASSERT BY RESOLUTION, NOT BY PATH. See ResolvedModalHost (test/support) for why
# a File.read of a fixed path cannot answer "which host renders", and for why the
# resolved identifier must never be asserted to contain "/gems/".

  # true inside a compiled Rails partial — it inherits the LAYOUT's yield — so the
  # engine's `yield if block_given?` guard carries no information and falls through
  # to view_flow[:layout], printing the whole page body inside the modal card. It
  # only fires during the LAYOUT pass, which is exactly how a modal host is mounted,
  # so a partial-render test cannot see it. This runs against a real page for that
