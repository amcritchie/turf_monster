# [component] The navbar after the brand rename and the link move.
#
# TWO THINGS THIS DEFENDS, and neither is visual.
#
# 1. THE RENAME IS BRAND-ONLY. "Turf Totals" names two different things in this
#    app: the product, and one of the two GAME MODES (turf_totals vs survivor).
#    A blanket rename reads as a tidy-up and quietly renames the mode — so pin
#    that the wordmark moved and the mode's own rules page did not.
# 2. THE MOVED LINKS ARE STILL REACHABLE. NFL Totals and Reserves left the bar
#    for the gear sidebar, and that sidebar is `return unless current_user`. A
#    logged-out visitor would lose NFL Totals entirely if the footer did not
#    carry it — which is a page vanishing from the site, not a layout tweak.

  # THE RULES LINK FOLLOWS THE SEASON, NOT THE BRAND. There are two versioned

  # Cup page (/turf-totals-v1) documents a logarithmic multiplier to x3.0 scored
  # on goals; the NFL page (/turf-monster-v1) documents a linear one to x2.0
  # scored on points, over a multi-week span. Pointing the navbar at the season
  # being played is a CONTENT decision and is not the rename this file guards —
  # turf-totals-v1 keeps its route, its name, and its footer link (asserted
  # above).
  #
  # Counted, not merely present: the bar draws Rules TWICE (desktop nav and the
  # mobile sub-navbar), and a repoint that moved only the one you looked at is
  # exactly the miss an assert_includes sails past.

  # ONE LABEL, ONE DESTINATION — the sweep that would have caught THIS bug.
  # Repointing the navbar at the NFL page left the FOOTER and the TRANSPARENCY
  # hub tile on the World Cup one, so the site shipped two contradictory
  # rulebooks under a single label: they disagree on the scoring unit (points
  # vs goals), the multiplier ceiling (x2.0 vs x3.0) and the tie rule. During
  # NFL season a player clicking footer Rules read the wrong rulebook for the
  # contest they were entering.
  #
  # Pinning each site's literal would rot exactly the way the miss did, so
  # SWEEP for the LABEL: any Rules link added anywhere tomorrow is covered
  # without editing this file, and one pointed at the wrong season fails here.
