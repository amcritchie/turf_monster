# [component] The Phantom MOBILE deep link, after this app stopped carrying its
# own copy of it.
#
# WHAT THIS REPLACED. turf-monster owned both halves of the mobile round trip —
# app/javascript/phantom_deeplink.js (the hand-off out to the Phantom app) and
# app/views/solana_sessions/phantom_callback.html.erb (the return leg) — and
# studio-engine took both, PROMOTED OUT OF THIS APP, which is why the diff was
# small. The two have SPLIT since: /tasks/turf-rides-gem-modals moved the deep
# link to solana-studio, and /tasks/drop-engine-web3-modals dropped the engine's
# copy in 0.66.2. This app runs above that floor, so the deep link comes from
# solana-studio and only the callback still comes from the engine. What this app
# keeps is the ROUTE, the controller action, and the blocking tweetnacl tag.
#
# THE TWO HALVES FAILED DIFFERENTLY, which is why they are asserted differently:
#
#   the deep link  was a JS MODULE, so there was no competing view path and no
#                  shadow — the engine partial was simply never rendered. Its
#                  ghost is a file on disk plus two loader lines.
#   the callback   was a TRUE SHADOW at the identical virtual path, winning
#                  resolution outright and leaving the engine's copy inert.
#
# THE CONTRACT THIS APP OWES THE PICKER, and the reason this file is not
# optional: solana_studio/modals/_wallet_connect suppresses Phantom's mobile INSTALL row
# on `self.isMobile && self.canDeepLink && i.name === 'Phantom'`, and canDeepLink
# is `typeof startPhantomDeepLink === 'function'`. Whether that global exists on
# the page therefore decides what a phone SEES, not merely what a tap does.
#
# WHAT LOSING IT ACTUALLY DOES, measured in a browser on 2026-08-30 rather than
# reasoned about — because the reasoning in circulation was BACKWARDS and this
# app's own comments carried it. Both getters read canDeepLink, so both flip
# together: `missingInstalls` stops filtering Phantom and `showPhantomDeepLink`
# goes false. A phone is therefore left with Phantom's INSTALL row, NOT with "no
# Phantom path at all". That is still a regression — you cannot install a browser
# extension on iOS Safari, so the row is a dead end and it is precisely the bug
# wallet_picker_single_phantom_test was written to kill — but it is a visible dead
# end rather than an empty list, and a reader hunting an empty list will not find
# it. Control run, iPhone 13 viewport, one variable changed:
#
#   global present   deep-link row VISIBLE   install rows: Solflare, Backpack
#   global deleted   deep-link row HIDDEN    install rows: Phantom, Solflare, Backpack
#
# TWO RENDER SITES. layouts/application and layouts/modal_preview keep SEPARATE
# registration lists, and both mount the picker — so both need the global. One
# render in shared/_alpine_factories covers both; these tests check the RENDERED
# pages rather than that arrangement, so a future third layout fails here.
# TWO FLOORS, AND THE MIGRATION MOVED ONLY PART OF ONE. Since
# /tasks/turf-rides-gem-modals the deep link is `solana_studio/_phantom_deeplink`
# and its floor is solana-studio 0.5.3, where it first exists.
#
# THE STUDIO-ENGINE 0.64.0 FLOOR SURVIVES THAT MOVE INTACT, which is the thing to
# get right before anyone tries to lower it: the `solana_sessions/phantom_callback`
# template, `Studio.wallet_debug_sink` and `Studio.wallet_sign_in_statement` all
# first exist in studio-engine 0.64.0 and NONE of them moved. The deep link and
# the callback are a MATCHED SIGNING PAIR — each reads
# Studio.wallet_sign_in_statement, unparameterized, and the callback rebuilds the
# signed message to verify it — so the gem partial now depends on studio-engine
# at RENDER time. Verified byte-level 2026-09-01 in the published artifacts: the
# gem's copy reads the helper exactly once, and phantom_callback reads it
# identically.
#
# Historical note: This file used to record that the pin UNDERSTATED that —
# `~> 0.63` with MINIMUM at 0.63.0 — and point at /tasks/raise-engine-pin-to-0-64
# as the change that would close it. That task landed, and the pin and MINIMUM
# have both moved well past 0.64 since.
#
# WHAT IS STILL TRUE, and the only part this file rests on, is that 0.64.0 is
# where the deep-link pair first exists — so it remains a floor for THIS surface,
# one the app's actual floor now sits above. The CURRENT pin and MINIMUM are
# deliberately not restated here: this paragraph named `~> 0.64` and MINIMUM
# 0.64.0 long after PR #581 replaced both, and every restatement is one more copy
# to go stale. test/lib/engine_pin_contract_test.rb owns them and asserts them
# against each other and against the Gemfile's floor note.
#
# The sharpest consequence is worth keeping in view here, because it is NOT what
# this file's own tests catch: `config/initializers/studio.rb` SETS
# `config.wallet_debug_sink`, so a bundle that walks back to 0.63 raises
# NoMethodError inside `Studio.configure` and the app never boots. The tests
# below would fail on such a bundle too, but the boot does first.

    # The first fix derived its list by grepping the view trees for calls to
    # startPhantomDeepLink. That finds the CALLERS and stops there. It misses
    # every modal that cannot call the deep link itself but can SWAP to one that
    # can — and because layouts/modal_preview registers the whole modal set on
    # every preview page, the swap target is always mounted and one tap away. So
    # auth (Solana button, openWalletHub) and web3-step-up both reached a picker
    # with no nacl behind it: the row painted and the tap threw. Same bug, a
    # door the grep could not see.
    #
    # The rule this asserts instead: a preview owes tweetnacl if the modal it
    # opens can reach a caller through any number of swap or open hops. It is
    # derived from the layout's own registrations, so a modal added there is
    # walked automatically rather than remembered, and it fails CLOSED — a swap
    # whose target is an ERB expression counts as reaching a caller, because a
    # target the test cannot read is exactly the case it must not wave through.
