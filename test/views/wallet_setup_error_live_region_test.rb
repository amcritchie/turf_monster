# [component] The connect-failure paragraph is a LIVE REGION, and it exists
# before the failure does.
#
# Pre-existing, found while fixing the raw/mapped pair (/tasks/raw-message-is-ours)
# and fixed in the same pass because it is the same paragraph: a screen reader
# was never told the connect failed. The modal's only feedback for a rejected or
# unusable wallet is this sentence, painted with no announcement, after a click
# that otherwise produces silence.
#
# WHY THE MARKUP SHAPE IS THE ASSERTION AND NOT JUST THE ATTRIBUTE. The
# paragraph was `<template x-if="error">`, so it did not exist until the error
# did — and a live region INSERTED alongside its own content is not reliably
# announced, because assistive technology has to be observing the region before
# the text lands in it. Adding aria-live to that markup would have been a green
# test over an unchanged experience. The region is now permanent inside the
# modal and only its VISIBILITY moves.
#
# WHAT THIS TIER CANNOT PROVE: that the sentence actually arrives after the
# region does at runtime. That is e2e/wallet_failure_report.spec.js, which reads
# the empty region while the modal is open and then watches it fill.
