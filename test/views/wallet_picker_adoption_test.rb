# [component] The Connect-Wallet picker, after this app stopped carrying its own
# copy of it.
#
# WHAT THIS REPLACED. turf-monster owned a 226-line modals/_wallet_connect while
# the shared copy sat at studio/modals/_wallet_connect — the partial PROMOTED OUT
# OF THIS APP, which is why the diff was small. That shared copy moved once more
# on 2026-09-01 (/tasks/turf-rides-gem-modals): solana-studio owns it now, at
# solana_studio/modals/_wallet_connect, and /tasks/drop-engine-web3-modals has
# since deleted studio-engine's. DIFFERENT virtual paths, so Rails
# resolution never collapsed them: this was a parallel COPY that simply won at
# every callsite, and the engine's copy was never reached. It had already drifted
# ahead — a live region on the connect error, a connecting-guard on the deep
# link, a brand-icon fallback chain that does not reach for an app-served SVG,
# and canDeepLink, which stops the mobile Phantom install row being suppressed in
# favour of a deep-link button that cannot work.
#
# WHAT IS LEFT FOR THIS APP TO DEFEND is the SEAM, not the picker. The owning
# gem tests the picker. This app supplies four hooks and one slot through
# WalletPickerHelper, and every one of them is the sort of thing that can go
# missing while the page still looks perfect:
#
#   onInit / canPick / verifyArgs / onDeepLink / onBack   (extra_data)
#   the legal-age attestation                             (slot)
#
# TWO RENDER SITES, and both must move. layouts/application and
# layouts/modal_preview keep SEPARATE modal registration lists, so a picker
# adopted in one and forked in the other renders the old copy at /admin/style
# forever, silently. The static guard below is derived from the layout glob
# rather than a hardcoded pair, so a third layout is covered the day it appears.
