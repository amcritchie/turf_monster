# [component] What a connect failure SAYS.
#
# Production, 2026-09-06: the Phantom extension was installed but held no wallet
# — Phantom was sitting on its own "create a new wallet or import an existing
# one" screen. With no keypair, signIn() rejects with Phantom's generic
# "Unexpected error", the connect+signMessage fallback rejects the same way, and
# that string used to reach parseSolanaError — whose generic branch reads it as a
# TRANSACTION failure and answers "Wallet couldn't process the transaction. Check
# wallet connection and USDC balance."
#
# Balance advice, in a connect modal, to someone who attempted no transaction and
# may hold no wallet at all.
#
# AND THEN THE CATCH TURNED OUT TO BE WIDER THAN ITS DIAGNOSIS. It wrapped the
# whole fallback, so the same sentence was also handed to a signMessage that
# failed AFTER connect() returned a public key, to a user who dismissed the
# account-selection sheet, and to anyone whose only problem was that our own
# server did not answer. The setup diagnosis now belongs to exactly one case: a
# connect() that never answered.
#
# WHAT THIS TIER CAN AND CANNOT PROVE. Everything below reads SOURCE. It pins
# form and order — the mutations a substring check is blind to — and it is fast.
# It cannot say which guard actually answered a real failure. That is
# e2e/wallet_sign_in.spec.js, which runs the function and compares the sentences
# the page EMITTED against each other; three of its four specs fail on the code
# this change replaces. Do not read a green file here as behaviour.
