# [component] The Get USDC card — the teaching half of the funds wall.
#
# Two contracts worth a test, and neither is visual.
#
# 1. IT IS BUILT FROM ENGINE BLOCKS. The card it is modelled on,
#    modals/_wallet_setup, hand-rolled its close mark for eight months while
#    blocks/_close_x homed the identical mark for eight other modals. A copy
#    reads fine and drifts silently, so pin that this one composes the primitive.
# 2. THE PLAYER IS OPTIONAL. The operator supplies the video after this ships
#    (BUY_USDC_VIDEO_ID). With none configured the band must render its heading
#    and its guide and simply have no player — an embed with an empty id renders
#    YouTube's own error card inside the modal instead.
