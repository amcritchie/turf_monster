# requireProvider, exercised in Node against the REAL module.
#
# THE DEFECT IT EXISTS FOR, reported from production 2026-09-07: `detect()`
# returns null whenever no wallet is injected, and on iOS Safari and Android
# Chrome that is ALWAYS — a mobile browser cannot host an extension. Six call
# sites dereferenced that null immediately, so a phone got
# `null is not an object (evaluating 'provider.connect')` printed into a
# transaction modal, while a user was trying to spend a FREE entry token.
#
# WHAT IS ASSERTED HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE: that the copy is DEVICE-APPROPRIATE.
# A message is not correct merely because it is not a stack trace — telling a
# phone to install a browser extension is advice nobody holding that phone can
# take, and it is what the wallet-export flow used to say. The negative
# assertions below are the load-bearing ones.
