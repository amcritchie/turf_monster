# onchainSettled() — the one seam every web3-transaction-success path calls.
#
# WHAT IT IS FOR. A balance read taken right after a broadcast is a coin flip:
# the transaction is confirmed but the RPC has not necessarily caught up, so the
# read returns the PRE-SPEND number. Measured on QA 2026-09-07 — a $75 contest
# creation, a session_refresh 828ms after finalize returned, and a navbar that
# showed the old balance confidently for the next minute.
#
# The three properties below are the ones that were NOT free, and each is
# asserted against the real module executed in node.
