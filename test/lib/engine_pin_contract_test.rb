# Contract for the studio-engine pin.
#
# The Gemfile pin reads `"~> 0.69", ">= 0.69.5"`. The `~>` half permits anything
# below 1.0, so a pin string alone does NOT tell you what this app runs. That gap
# has bitten three times. Reading the pin as the version is how "turf is on 0.31"
# got believed while the lockfile said 0.39; `~> 0.42` later let the lockfile
# reach 0.43 with nobody ADOPTING 0.43, which is what installs its migrations —
# the drift the migration check below now asserts against; and most recently
# `~> 0.64` said nothing whatever about the 0.69.5 this app had come to require,
# because a two-segment `~>` CANNOT state a patch-level floor. That is why the
# pin carries a second requirement, why the guard reads the requirement's
# effective lower bound at full precision, and why there is now a guard that
# derives the question from the source instead of from a number.
# These assert the FLOOR we actually depend on, so a `bundle update` that walked
# the resolved version backwards fails here instead of at runtime.
#
# THE CONTRACT IS NOW DERIVED, NOT ENUMERATED. This file used to answer "is the
# schema current?" with a hand-written list of `studio_email_settings` columns.
# That list went stale at the 0.42 columns while the lockfile resolved 0.43 —
# green test, drifted app — and re-typing it only resets the clock. Worse, a
# column list can only ever defend the ONE table somebody thought to list: when
# 0.46 added the standard user-profile columns to `users`, this file stayed green
# through the entire drift, because `users` was not on the list and never would
# have been. The migration check below asks the general question instead.
class EnginePinContractTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  # Raised deliberately by the 0.42 adoption. Each entry is a feature this app
  # now relies on, with the version that introduced it — so the floor is
  # justified rather than aspirational.
  #
  #   0.36 — Studio::LocalReviewsController resolves the reviewer itself
  #          (Studio.local_review_email, else the seeded admin), which is what
  #          makes the task board's email-free WAITING APPROVAL button work.
  #   0.42 — Studio::EmailSetting backs the operator-editable layered email
  #          banner on /admin/emails, a page this app mounts from the engine.
  #   0.43 — EmailCatalog records WHOSE a background is at registration, so a
  #          host that ships its own artwork can layer. 0.42 gated it on the
  #          ENGINE owning the flat image, and this app owns its own .jpg — so
  #          on 0.42 the sign-in email silently falls back to the flat banner.
  #          That is the failure this floor exists to catch: nothing raises, the
  #          email just stops carrying the artwork.
  #   0.46 — Studio::OnboardingController serves the first-name step, and
  #          Studio.first_name_outstanding? / FIRST_NAME_SKIP_SESSION_KEY /
  #          draw_onboarding_routes / onboarding_steps_resolver are the seam this
  #          app adopted it through. This app DELETED its local copy, so below
  #          0.46 the routes are never drawn and the onboarding modal's two
  #          hardcoded POSTs 404 — the chain stalls on the first-name step.
  #   0.52 — Studio.draw_profile_routes serves the shared /profile page,
  #          Studio::ProfileSections is the registry this app declares its own
  #          rows through (config/initializers/studio.rb replaces the newsletter
  #          row and appends quests), and Studio::Newsletter backs both. The
  #          Gemfile comment moved to 0.52 when that landed; THIS constant did
  #          not, which is the drift the file exists to catch and did not.
  #   0.54 — studio/fields/_date_of_birth, the engine's one DOB field.
  #          app/views/modals/_birthday renders it instead of its old forked
  #          copy of the three selects. This is the sharpest floor in the list
  #          because it fails LOUDLY and immediately: below 0.54 the partial does
  #          not exist, so the age-gate modal raises on render rather than
  #          degrading. It also carries /profile/edit's birthday row off the
  #          retired calendar popover onto the same three selects.
  #   0.56 — studio/_hold_button + studio/_fizz_layer + Studio::FizzHelper, and
  #          the ACTION family (.hold-btn / .hold-stack / .fizz-bit) in
  #          engine-motion.css. This app DELETED its local copy of all four —
  #          the two partials, the helper, and ~500 lines of duplicated CSS — so
  #          below 0.56 the contest board's confirm button raises on render, and
  #          the entry-token modals with it. Same shape as the 0.54 floor: it
  #          fails loudly rather than degrading, which is the kind of floor
  #          worth having.
  #   0.57 — the geo primitive this app now RENDERS instead of carrying:
  #          Studio::GeoDetection (detection, the geo_* helpers,
  #          require_geo_allowed), Studio::GeoSetting + the studio_geo_settings
  #          table, the /admin/geo manager and the public /geo/check probe drawn
  #          by config.draw_geo_routes, components/_geo_badge, and the 52 US
  #          state flags as gem assets. This app DELETED its local model, helper,
  #          controller, view, badge partial, geocoder initializer, routes and
  #          public/state-flags, so below 0.57 ApplicationController raises at
  #          `include Studio::GeoDetection` and the app does not boot at all —
  #          the loudest floor in this list, which is the kind worth having.
  #   0.63 — the shared LAYER SCALE, and the QUIETEST floor in this list. The
  #          0.54 and 0.57 floors above fail loudly — a missing partial raises
  #          on render, a missing concern raises at boot. This one raises
  #          nothing at all, which is why it is asserted rather than trusted.
  #          0.63.0 first defines the --z-* tiers in engine.css's :root, ships the
  #          body.modal-open lift for the bar stack AND the app banner, and
  #          defaults the toast seams to the tiers in layouts/studio/_flash. This
  #          app MIRRORED all three in an application.css adoption shim until
  #          delete-turf-layer-shim removed the mirror — it sat after the engine
  #          import, so it OUTRANKED the gem it was copying. With no local copy
  #          left, below 0.63.0 every var(--z-*) here resolves to nothing and the
  #          modal backdrop, navbar, drawer, docked slip and toasts all fall to
  #          z-index:auto — the page silently loses its stacking order entirely.
  #   0.64 — the WALLET surface, and the only floor in this list that stops the
  #          app BOOTING. Three adoptions land on one version:
  #            * `Studio.wallet_debug_sink` and `Studio.wallet_sign_in_statement`
  #              (via the wallet_sign_in_statement_builder accessor) first exist
  #              in 0.64.0's lib/studio.rb. config/initializers/studio.rb SETS
  #              the first of them, so below 0.64.0 `Studio.configure` raises
  #              NoMethodError and nothing boots — louder even than the 0.57 geo
  #              floor, which at least got as far as the concern.
  #            * the solana_sessions/phantom_callback template — the mobile
  #              return leg. This app DELETED both halves of the round trip
  #              (app/javascript/phantom_deeplink.js and its own phantom_callback
  #              view), and the callback half is STILL the engine's, so below
  #              0.64.0 the return leg has no template at all.
  #
  #          WHAT LEFT THIS FLOOR ON 2026-09-01, and why the floor did not move:
  #          /tasks/turf-rides-gem-modals moved the PARTIALS to solana-studio.
  #          studio/solana/_phantom_deeplink, studio/modals/_wallet_connect and
  #          studio/modals/_web3_step_up are no longer rendered from the engine
  #          here, so they no longer justify an engine floor — their floor is now
  #          solana-studio 0.5.3 (see SOLANA_STUDIO_MINIMUM below), and the same
  #          goes for the shared picker's `canDeepLink` getter, which travelled
  #          with the picker.
  #
  #          THE ENGINE FLOOR STAYS AT 0.64.0 ANYWAY, on the two bullets above,
  #          and BOTH are independent of the partials: the accessors are set in
  #          this app's initializer (a BOOT failure) and the callback template is
  #          still the engine's. The migration therefore removes a REASON without
  #          moving the NUMBER. There is a third tie besides: the gem's
  #          _phantom_deeplink itself reads Studio.wallet_sign_in_statement, so
  #          the partials depend on studio-engine >= 0.64 at RENDER time even
  #          from inside solana-studio.
  #          DERIVED BY DATING EVERY SURFACE, not by reading a changelog — the
  #          gem's CHANGELOG files everything after 0.39 under "Unreleased", so
  #          it cannot date anything here. Each partial rendered, accessor
  #          configured and symbol named was traced to its FIRST appearance
  #          across the installed 0.4.13-0.65.2 trees; 0.64.0 is the maximum.
  #   0.69.5 — Studio::FULL_NAME_MAX_LENGTH, and the FIRST floor in this list
  #          that is a PATCH rather than a minor. turf-modal-caps-forty
  #          (PR 573) made the constant a RENDER-TIME dependency on EVERY
  #          page: layouts/application renders modals/_onboarding
  #          unconditionally and the <template x-if> wrapper is CLIENT-side,
  #          so the ERB evaluates on every request and reads the constant for
  #          the field's maxlength. Below 0.69.5 that is a NameError on every
  #          page render — a TOTAL outage, the same class as the 0.64 boot
  #          failure above, not a degraded field.
  #          DATED TWO WAYS, because the number is the whole point here,
  #          and BOTH ARE STATED AS A MINIMUM RATHER THAN AS A LIST:
  #          grepping every installed studio-engine tree, across both Ruby
  #          gem homes, for the ASSIGNMENT `FULL_NAME_MAX_LENGTH =` under
  #          lib/ and app/ finds the LOWEST version defining it to be
  #          0.69.5, and NO version below it defines it (the COUNT of those
  #          versions is deliberately absent: it describes one laptop's
  #          unpacked gems, not the gem);
  #          and in the gem repo the EARLIEST tag containing the commit
  #          that adds it (f2c2d1c, 2026-09-06) is v0.69.5, while that
  #          commit's own version.rb still reads 0.69.4 — so 0.69.4 is the
  #          last release WITHOUT it.
  #          WHY "EARLIEST" AND "LOWEST" RATHER THAN A LIST — this sentence
  #          learned it by rotting. It used to read "contained by exactly
  #          the v0.69.5 and v0.70.0 tags", and that was TRUE WHEN IT WAS
  #          WRITTEN AND FALSE FIVE MINUTES LATER — the sharper version of
  #          the lesson, because no care at writing time prevents it.
  #          e68837c3 wrote the sentence at 00:24:22; v0.71.0's TAG OBJECT
  #          was created at 00:29:14, 4m52s AFTER. The author was still in
  #          the line: 4f5c3e76 rewrote it at 00:31:55, 2m41s past false,
  #          and shipped it; it was still false at the #581 merge
  #          (01:07:18), and v0.72.0 was tagged 01:09:11. All times
  #          2026-09-07 -0600. THE CLOCK IS THE TAG OBJECT'S OWN DATE
  #          (`git for-each-ref --format='%(taggerdate:iso-strict)'
  #          refs/tags/v0.71.0`), NOT the tagged commit's (00:12:26, `git
  #          log -1 --format=%cI v0.71.0^{}`), because `git tag --contains`
  #          answers about tags that EXIST — and reading the second as the
  #          first is what INVERTED the first telling of this story.
  #          Measured 2026-09-07, four tags contain f2c2d1c. An enumeration
  #          of containing tags is a CLOCK, not a fact — every release
  #          falsifies it — so the note whose whole job is to keep a floor
  #          from rotting rotted in under five minutes. The EARLIEST one moves
  #          only if a release DELETES the constant, and that is what the
  #          derived guard below catches. The citation is now asserted
  #          rather than trusted: see "the floor note's tag citation names
  #          the EARLIEST tag containing the commit it names" below.
  #          WHY THE PIN GREW A SECOND REQUIREMENT, and why the guard below
  #          changed shape with it: `~> 0.69` means `>= 0.69, < 1.0`, so it
  #          ADMITS 0.69.0 through 0.69.4 — the exact window that raises. A
  #          two-segment `~>` CANNOT express a patch floor. The pin now reads
  #          `"~> 0.69", ">= 0.69.5"`, and the pin guard below compares the
  #          requirement's EFFECTIVE lower bound at full precision instead of
  #          the `~>` operand's first two segments — which is what let a floor
  #          five releases too low agree with itself here.

  end

  # ── THE FLOOR, ASKED OF THE SOURCE INSTEAD OF OF A NUMBER ───────────────
  #
  # MINIMUM above is hand-written, and a hand-written floor rots in exactly one
  # way: the app grows a reference to something NEWER than the number, and
  # nothing says so. That is not hypothetical here — it is what this test was
  # written for. turf-modal-caps-forty adopted Studio::FULL_NAME_MAX_LENGTH,
  # which first exists in 0.69.5, while MINIMUM still read 0.64.0 and the pin
  # still read `~> 0.64`. Every resolve in [0.64.0, 0.69.4] passed the guard
  # above — the guard that exists to catch a backwards resolve — and then raised
  # NameError on every page render. Bumping the number closes that window and
  # leaves the MECHANISM intact: the next adoption reopens it in silence.
  #
  # This asks the question the number was standing in for, and derives both
  # sides. The app's side is every `Studio::` constant its own source NAMES; the
  # engine's side is what the RESOLVED gem actually defines. A backwards resolve
  # fails here without anyone having remembered anything, and so does a constant
  # the engine REMOVES on the way up — which no floor can ever catch.
  #
  # WHY IT DOES NOT DATE CONSTANTS ACROSS GEM VERSIONS, which is the guard that
  # first suggests itself: "resolve the earliest engine version defining each
  # reference, and fail when the pin sits below the maximum of those" computes a
  # better answer — it would tell you the floor IS 0.69.5 rather than merely
  # that today's resolve is wrong. It needs every historical gem tree to do it.
  # Locally that is 128 unpacked studio-engine trees at 22 MB each, 1.1 GB. CI
  # installs from Gemfile.lock (`bundler-cache: true`), so it has exactly ONE
  # tree — the resolved one — and a guard that can only run on the laptop that
  # happens to have the other 127 is not a guard. This version needs no history
  # at all: whatever bundler resolved is on disk by definition, so it runs
  # everywhere the suite runs, which is the property that makes it bite.
  #
  # It is the WEAKER question and the STRONGER guard, and the pair is the point:
  # the pin refuses the bad resolve, and this catches it if the pin is ever
  # wrong again.

  # _phantom_deeplink and _deeplink_assets FIRST EXIST. Derived by unpacking the

  #
  # WHY THIS ONE IS NOT INVISIBLE TO THE RESOLVER, unlike every studio-engine
  # bump above. Those were all two-segment pins, so the old `~>` already admitted
  # the new floor and only the COMMENT moved. This app's pin was `~> 0.5` and it

  # this app on 2026-09-01 all four partials above resolved MISSING through a
  # real LookupContext while studio-engine's copies still resolved FOUND. A
  # missing partial in a `render` call raises NOTHING: the Connect-Wallet picker,
  # the step-up card and the whole mobile Phantom leg would each have rendered as
  # an EMPTY modal. That is why the Gemfile pin is three segments now, and why

  # SELF-FIRING, and that is the whole design.
  #
  # The layer-scale ADOPTION SHIM — a local :root in application.css mirroring
  # the engine's --z-* tiers — was CORRECT while the pin predated the gem that
  # ships them, and became a liability the instant it did not. application.css
  # imports the engine build at the top and the shim's :root came after it, so on
  # equal specificity and later source order THE SHIM WON. This app kept a frozen
  # private copy of the shared scale while believing it shared one, and the next
  # engine layer change would simply not have arrived. Nothing failed. Nothing
  # looked wrong. It was found by a reviewer reading another repo's diff.
  #
  # A code comment or a ledger entry saying "delete at the bump" is a reminder,
  # not a gate — the previous one lived in a task's agent_context, which archives
  # away with the task. This asks the question the bump itself answers: once the
  # RESOLVED engine defines a tier, any local definition of it is drift. Silent
  # while the pin is old; red the instant it is not.
  #
  # TWO THINGS IT DELIBERATELY DOES DIFFERENTLY FROM THE HUB'S FIRST CUT of this
  # guard, both found in review there and not worth inheriting:
  #
  #   1. NO TRAILING SEMICOLON IS REQUIRED. The hub matched
  #      /(--z-[a-z-]+):\s*-?\d+;/, so a legal `:root { --z-modal: 999 }` — last
  #      declaration in a block, no `;` — evaded it in silence. This matches the
  #      NAME and its colon and does not care what follows, which also catches a
  #      redefinition to a var() or a calc() rather than only to an integer.
  #   2. IT SCANS EVERY SOURCE CSS FILE THIS APP SHIPS, not one filename. The
  #      hub scanned application.css alone while a second stylesheet was imported
  #      after the engine with identical outranking power, so a tier relocated by
  #      one line into that file evaded the guard completely. The order matters
  #      and the filename does not: everything this app ships is loaded after the
  #      engine build it imports first.

  # `=` IS HERE BECAUSE ITS ABSENCE MISDESCRIBED THE FAILURE, not because an

  # bound" — which for `>` is the honest description.

  # A list that pairs `=` with a HIGHER `>=` is unsatisfiable, and `.max` would

  # WHY THE LOCKFILE IS NOT GUARDED HERE, written down because the obvious guard
  # is INERT and was very nearly shipped.
  #
  # The floor is stated in three files, not two: the Gemfile pin, MINIMUM above,
  # and Gemfile.lock's DEPENDENCIES entry (`studio-engine (~> 0.69, >= 0.69.5)`, a
  # separate fact from the resolved version in the GEM section). A test asserting
  # the third against the first looks like the natural completion of the pair
  # above. It cannot work, in BOTH directions:
  #
  #   locally  a non-frozen bundler REWRITES Gemfile.lock to agree with the
  #            Gemfile during boot — so by the time any test reads the file the
  #            drift has already been repaired. Measured on 2026-08-30: editing
  #            the DEPENDENCIES entry to `~> 0.63` and running this file left it
  #            reading `~> 0.64` afterwards, and the assertion passed. Every
  #            mutation of that guard is erased by the act of running it.
  #   frozen   `bundle install --deployment` / BUNDLE_FROZEN compares exactly
  #            those two and REFUSES, before Rails boots. The suite never runs,
  #            so the test could not report even if it were right.
  #
  # So bundler already owns this seam at both ends, and owns it better than a
  # test could: it repairs the drift where repair is safe and refuses where it is
  # not. What is left for this file is the pair bundler CANNOT see — the pin
  # against MINIMUM (above) and against the floor note (below), both of which are
  # prose-and-constant agreements no resolver has an opinion about.

  # THE FLOOR NOTE AND THE PIN MUST AGREE — the third statement of the same fact,
  # and the one that actually drifted into this task.
  #
  # The pin carries a hand-written chain of floor notes, each opening
  # `<version> is the real floor, and the pin SAYS so.` and demoting its
  # predecessor to `PRIOR FLOOR NOTE, still true:`. That leading version is a
  # THIRD copy of the floor, in prose — and prose is exactly what goes stale
  # while the constants stay in step. The 0.63 note kept claiming 0.63 was the
  # real floor for the whole window in which this app adopted the engine's
  # Phantom deep link and its wallet accessors, which moved the true floor to
  # 0.64 (see MINIMUM's 0.64 entry). Nothing was red: the pin and MINIMUM agreed
  # with each other and both were wrong together.
  #
  # This asserts the note's leading version against the pin, so a bump that moves
  # the numbers without writing the paragraph that JUSTIFIES them fails here. It
  # cannot check that the paragraph is TRUE — only a human dating the gem trees
  # can — but it can guarantee the paragraph is about the version actually pinned,
  # which is what makes the rest of the comment worth reading.

  # ── THE NOTE'S TAG CITATION, ASSERTED INSTEAD OF TRUSTED ────────────────
  #
  # THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR IS THIS NOTE'S OWN. The floor note dated
  # Studio::FULL_NAME_MAX_LENGTH by naming the gem commit that adds it and the
  # tags containing that commit — and it ENUMERATED them: "contained by exactly
  # two tags, v0.69.5 and v0.70.0". That sentence was TRUE WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN
  # AND FALSE FIVE MINUTES LATER. e68837c3 committed it at 00:24:22; v0.71.0's
  # TAG OBJECT was created at 00:29:14 — 4m52s AFTER. The author had not even
  # left the line: 4f5c3e76 re-edited it at 00:31:55, 2m41s after it had gone
  # false, and shipped it; it was still false at the #581 merge (01:07:18), and
  # v0.72.0 was tagged 01:09:11. All times 2026-09-07 -0600, read off the TAG
  # OBJECT's own creation date rather than its tagged commit's (00:12:26),
  # because `git tag --contains` answers about tags that EXIST. The note whose
  # entire job is to keep a floor from rotting rotted in five minutes, and
  # nothing was red.
  #
  # TRUE-THEN-FALSE IS THE WORSE FAILURE, AND THE WHOLE ARGUMENT FOR COMPUTING
  # THIS. A claim that is false on arrival is an author's mistake, and one
  # careful reader catches it. A claim that is true when written and false
  # before its author stops editing the line cannot be caught by care at all —
  # the world moved, not the sentence. Only re-deriving it on every run catches
  # that, which is what this test does.
  #
  # THE FIX IS THE SHAPE OF THE CLAIM, NOT THE NUMBERS IN IT. A list of
  # containing tags is a clock: every release falsifies it, so it is guaranteed
  # to be wrong and merely a question of when. The EARLIEST containing tag is a
  # fact about the commit — it moves only if a release DELETES the constant,
  # which is the one case the derived guard above already catches. So the note
  # now says "the EARLIEST tag containing … is vX.Y.Z", and this reads that
  # sentence back and checks it.
  #
  # NO VERSION LITERAL APPEARS BELOW, deliberately. The expected value is
  # MINIMUM, so a floor bump moves the note, the pin and this guard together or
  # goes red. A guard pinning "v0.69.5" would be the same class of statement
  # that just rotted — a hand-copied number with nothing keeping it honest.
  #
  # IT RUNS IN TWO HALVES, because only one of them can run everywhere:
  #
  #   ALWAYS — the note is parsed and the version it cites is compared to
  #     MINIMUM. Needs nothing but the Gemfile, so CI runs it.
  #   WHERE THE GEM'S GIT CHECKOUT IS REACHABLE — the earliest containing tag
  #     is COMPUTED from the commit the note names and compared to MINIMUM.
  #     CI installs from Gemfile.lock and has no gem repo, so this half skips
  #     there, narrowly and loudly: the skip fires only when no checkout
  #     carrying the `v<MINIMUM>` tag can be found. A checkout that HAS that
  #     tag and does not know the commit is a wrong SHA and fails.

  # v0.70.0, v0.71.0, v0.72.0), and those order identically under both rules —

  # because every containing tag today has a two-digit minor and "0.69.5" <
  # "0.70.0" reads the same either way. So deleting the version ordering
  # altogether changes no answer that test can see, and it survives — measured,
  # not assumed. A guard whose recompute agrees with the value it checks for the
  # wrong reason is inert, and that is the exact defect this task family is
  # about.

  # assignment, which fails here first and with a better message. Keeping both
  # bought nothing and cost the thing that actually hurt: the list had to be
  # hand-extended on every engine release, and the release it was NOT extended
  # for is the one that drifted. The general question ("is any engine migration
  # uninstalled?") is now asked once, above, for every engine table at once.
  #
  # THE PATH THAT ACTUALLY BREAKS:
  #
  # Studio::EmailSetting.table_ready? checks only table_exists?, never columns,
  # so nothing raises at boot. READS survive too — the table is empty in a fresh
  # app, so the &. chain short-circuits before touching a missing column. The
  # SAVE path is unconditional: Studio::EmailsController#copy assigns
  # record.body=, which is a NoMethodError against a 0.42-era table.
  #
  # So /admin/emails renders perfectly and cannot save, and it is silent until
  # somebody presses Save. Asserting the WRITE is what turns that from luck into
  # a mechanism.

    # using the names the guard bans — so scanning them would make documenting the
    # fix impossible.

    # BUT THE STRIPPER IS THE FAIL-OPEN RISK IN ANY SUCH GUARD, and this one
    # guards a defect that is already invisible. A bare `/\*.*?\*/m` span-strip
    # pairs a stray `/*` — inside a string, a url(), or a nested-looking opener —
    # with a genuine `*/` far below it and eats everything between: the scan still
    # runs, still passes, and is reading nothing. That exact failure cost this repo
    # real coverage once, swallowing 93% of a file (see `without_block_comments` in
    # test/views/layer_scale_adoption_test.rb, which is where this shape is from).
    #
    # So span-strip ONLY when the file's openers and closers BALANCE. Otherwise
    # drop whole-line comments, where a stray opener costs one line instead of the
    # rest of the file. Both directions are asserted below, on fixtures.

    # `.studio_engine` and `.studio` across the engine's history.

    # THIS APP COVERS TWO ENGINE MIGRATIONS WITH ITS OWN NATIVES, and that is
    # correct rather than drift: `create_studio_links` and
    # `allow_null_image_cache_owner` exist here as hand-written migrations
    # (db/migrate/20260621120000_create_studio_links.rb and
    # 20260621120001_allow_null_image_cache_owner.rb) that predate the engine
    # shipping its own. `install:migrations` itself skips them for exactly this
    # reason ("Migration with the same name already exists"). Matching on the
    # bare name — not on the suffix — is what makes this check agree with the
    # installer instead of reporting two permanent false positives.
