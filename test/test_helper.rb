# --- LOCAL TEST PARALLELISM: single-process here, parallel in CI ---------------------
#
# Rails forks a worker per processor once a run crosses its 50-test threshold, and each
# worker opens its own PG connection in an `after_fork_hook`. ON THIS MACHINE THAT FORK
# SEGFAULTS, and the way it fails is the problem: the workers die, the parent never
# learns, and it parks on the DRb channel it hands them work over, waiting for results
# that can never arrive.
#
# MEASURED HERE, 2026-08-22 (/tasks/fix-parallel-test-deadlock). Four pre-existing test
# files (~73 tests, over the threshold), no diff of any kind:
#
#   14 forked workers, ALL of them <defunct> within 15s
#   pg-1.6.3-arm64-darwin/lib/pg/connection.rb:944 — [BUG] Segmentation fault,
#     raised from active_record/test_databases.rb:15 (the after_fork_hook), i.e.
#     BEFORE ANY TEST RAN
#   parent alive, `sample` shows it blocked in drb.rb:1584 -> rb_f_select
#   1.26s of CPU across 150s of wall clock — 0% busy, waiting on the dead
#   the same lane with PARALLEL_WORKERS=1: 102 runs, 420 assertions, 0 failures, 6s
#
# Left alone it hangs FOREVER: the original sighting ran 41 minutes before a harness
# timeout killed it. OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES was tried and does NOT
# help — the segfault is inside libpq, not the ObjC runtime.
#
# THIS IS A MITIGATION, NOT A FIX. The fork-safety bug is upstream (pg + macOS) and is
# still there; we route around it by not forking locally. Nothing is skipped and no
# coverage is lost — the same tests run, in one process. CI is Linux, forks fine, and
# keeps the parallel speedup, so this costs the pipeline nothing.
#
# mcritchie-studio's test_helper.rb carries the same guard, measured independently on
# 2026-08-18 and landing on the SAME pg/connection.rb:944 — deliberately duplicated
# rather than shared, because a test_helper cannot depend on the gem whose suite it
# boots. Change one, change the other.
#
# PARALLEL_WORKERS_ALLOW_UNSAFE=1 restores the requested count for exactly one purpose:
# re-running the measurement above after a Ruby, pg, or macOS bump. It is not a
# performance switch. If it stops crashing, change the DEFAULT on the evidence and
# delete this guard — do not leave the hatch as the way in.

        over DRb, and the run HANGS — 41 minutes, at 0% CPU, in the sighting that put
        this guard here. This is an ENV limitation, NOT a problem with your diff.

  # The RAW source of every <template> registration for one modal id, straight
  # out of a response body.
  #
  # WHY RAW, AND NOT NOKOGIRI. Some assertions about a modal registration are
  # about DELIMITERS — the classic one being a double quote inside the
  # double-quoted x-data attribute, which closes it early and makes Alpine mount
  # the whole component as a silent no-op that still renders markup. A parser has
  # already resolved those by the time it hands back a node, and re-serializing a
  # mangled attribute can hide exactly the damage being looked for.
  #
  # WHY IT COUNTS NESTING. A naive `<template ...>.*?</template>` is WRONG here
  # and fails in the least helpful way: several engine cards contain an inner
  # `<template x-if="error">`, so the lazy match stops at the INNER closing tag
  # and silently returns a truncated card. Assertions about anything below that
  # point — the submit button, the skip link — then fail as "not present" on
  # markup that is present. Measured while adopting the first-name card, where it
  # cost three confusing failures before the slice itself was suspected.
