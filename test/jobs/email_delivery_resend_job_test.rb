# THE FAILURE IT EXISTS FOR, measured on mainnet 2026-09-07: settling
# turf-totals-alpha-contest-v1 paid dunkpark4@gmail.com $100 and left their
# winner email at sent=false, sent_at=nil and error=nil, while the other
# winner's row — created in the same second — sent fine. Sidekiq held nothing:
# enqueued 0, retry 0, dead 0. No retry was coming, and a player who had been
# paid would never have been told.
#
# So the case under test is specifically the SILENT one. A row with an error is
# already Sidekiq's problem; a row with no error and no job is nobody's, and
# that is the hole.
