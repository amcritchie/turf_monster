# A `path/to/file.rb:NN` CITATION IS A CLAIM ABOUT RUNNING CODE, and until this
# test existed nothing checked it. docs/workflows/web3-landing-to-entry.md opens
# with "Code is law. Every claim below cites path/to/file.rb:NN from the current
# codebase" — a promise that a reader can follow any number in it straight to the
# thing it names. Nothing enforced that promise, so every refactor quietly spent
# it, and the numbers rotted at the speed the app moved.
#
# MEASURED BY THIS FILE, 2026-09-08, against the document as it then stood: 113
# citations, of which 14 landed on the code they named. The other 99 break down
# as 54 landing inside a DIFFERENT method than the prose names, 30 landing in
# code with no enclosing method and quoting nothing found there, 6 pointing past
# the end of their file, 2 naming files that had GRADUATED TO THE studio-engine
# GEM and no longer existed in this repo, and 7 written in a `Symbol#method:NN`
# form that resolves to no file at all. Worked examples:
# `Entry#confirm_onchain!` was cited at entry.rb:130 — that line is inside
# `assert_enterable!`, and the method had moved to :242 — and
# `ContestsController#confirm_onchain_entry` at :568, which is `def world_cup`;
# the action had moved to :1284.
#
# WHY THE DRIFT IS WORSE THAN A MISSING CITATION. A wrong number does not read as
# wrong. It reads as freshly verified — someone went and looked — so a reader
# lands on unrelated code and concludes the DOC is describing something subtle
# rather than that the number is stale. That is also why the sweep it guards was
# all-or-nothing: correcting one citation inside a bullet whose siblings are also
# stale produces a bullet that reads verified and is not.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT A "DOES LINE NN EXIST" CHECK. Every stale citation above was
# in-bounds. contests_controller.rb is 2739 lines; :568 exists, it just is not
# `confirm_onchain_entry`. A bounds check passes on all 113 and proves nothing.
# So THE SYMBOL IS THE CLAIM AND THE NUMBER IS BOOKKEEPING, and this guard is
# keyed on the symbol:
#
#   * for a .rb file, the enclosing definition of the cited line is derived with
#     Prism (the parser Ruby itself ships), not with a `def` regex;
#   * for an .erb file, the inline-JS factory members are located by brace
#     balance — `_turf_totals_board.html.erb` defines `selectionBoard()` inline
#     because Alpine processes x-data before importmap modules load, so its
#     methods are ERB text and no Ruby parser sees them;
#   * where the cited lines sit inside a definition, the prose MUST name that
#     definition — nothing else will do;
#   * only where there is no enclosing definition (a routes.rb entry, ERB markup,
#     a JSON block, a callback declaration in a class body) does it fall back to
#     asking that a code token the prose quotes appear in the cited lines.
#
# Move a method and the number under it stops matching the symbol beside it, so
# the citation reddens HERE rather than misleading a reader six months on.
#
# THE FLOOR IS PART OF THE GUARD, not decoration. A sweep whose regex stops
# matching passes having proved nothing, which is the failure mode this whole
# class of test is prone to: rename the citation style, match zero, assert
# nothing, stay green. So the parse is asserted to find at least MIN_CITATIONS,
# and to find both citation SHAPES the document uses. Deleting citations
# below the floor is a deliberate act that has to move a number in this file.
#
# ITS LIMITS, STATED PLAINLY.
#
#   1. IT GUARDS ONE DOCUMENT. docs/workflows/ holds 366 more citations across
#      five other documents (admin-contest-setup 122, email-signup-token-to-chat
#      98, referral-google-tokens-to-chat 55, slate-build 48, market-snapshot 43)
#      and NONE of them are checked here. Adding one is a line in GUARDED_DOCS
#      plus whatever sweep that doc then needs — do not read this file as
#      covering the directory.
#   2. IT CANNOT CHECK PROSE. It proves a citation lands on the symbol the prose
#      names. It cannot prove the sentence about that symbol is true, and the
#      same sweep found sentences that were: the document described a client-side
#      broadcast (`connection.sendRawTransaction`) and a `stamp_entry_signature`
#      round trip that the code had stopped doing. Nothing mechanical catches
#      that — only reading the code does.
#   3. CROSS-REPO REFERENCES CARRY NO LINE NUMBER, on purpose. studio-engine is
#      a versioned gem (`~> 0.72`), so a line number in it would rot on an
#      unrelated `bundle update` and redden this test for a change nobody made
#      here. Those citations name the file and the symbol, and are checked
#      against the RESOLVED gem — the symbol survives the bump, the number would
#      not.
