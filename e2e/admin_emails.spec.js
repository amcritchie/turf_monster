  // It stops at "the form submitted and the page came back". It deliberately
  // does NOT assert that the row became app-owned, because the banner write
  // goes through Studio::S3 to a REAL bucket, and CI runs with deliberately
  // dummy AWS credentials (see ci.yml: test storage is :test/Disk, so the creds
  // never reach real S3). The avatar upload beside this one survives that
  // because it rides ActiveStorage; this one does not. Asserting the app-owned
  // outcome here fails on CI and passes locally, which is the worst shape a
  // test can have.

  //
  // What only a browser can prove, and what this therefore keeps: the page
  // mounts its OWN modal host (emailModals) because not every consuming app
  // renders a shared one — if that store fails to register, the upload control
  // is inert and NO server-side test notices.
  //
  // WHERE the control lives is engine-owned and has already moved once. Through
  // studio-engine 0.42 the list page carried an Upload/Replace button per row;
  // 0.43 deleted it and left one control, on the email's OWN page, over the
  // artwork it replaces. Both versions render that control, so this spec runs on
  // either. It is pinned by its accessible name — the label an operator reads —
  // and deliberately NOT by `data-modify-artwork`, which appears exactly once in
  // the whole engine (on the button) with nothing reading it: an attribute no
  // engine test protects is a worse contract than the words on the button.
