// THE LANE'S MOTION ENVIRONMENT, ASSERTED RATHER THAN BELIEVED.
//
// playwright.config.js has declared `reducedMotion: "reduce"` for months and it
// DID NOT REACH THE PAGE. Written as a bare `use.reducedMotion` key it is inert
// in Playwright 1.58.2; only `use.contextOptions.reducedMotion` applies. So every
// spec ran at the browser default while the config said the opposite, and any
// spec written believing motion was off was measuring something other than it
// thought. (The catalogued casualty: .legendary-badge pans its gradient forever,
// so a screenshot crop containing the disc differs on EVERY frame and an
// assertion built on one can never fail — see e2e/navbar_layout.spec.js.)
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A CONFIG-TEXT TEST. A test that greps
// playwright.config.js for a string proves the string is there — which was ALREADY
// TRUE the whole time the setting did nothing. Reading the config is not evidence
// about the browser. The only thing that is: ask a real page, running under the
// real config, through the real runner.
//
// So the guard below asks TWO different witnesses, because each covers the
// other's blind spot:
//
//   JS   — matchMedia(...).matches, the flag every inline script in this app
//          branches on (contests/live.html.erb:18, contests/_chat_panel.html.erb:288,
//          and the engine's studio/modals/onboarding/_first_name, which this app
//          renders for the first-name step).
//   CSS  — whether the STYLE ENGINE honors the query, measured by animating a
//          probe element that a @media block is supposed to silence. matchMedia
//          could in principle report true while the cascade ignored it, and it is
//          the cascade that nine blocks in app/assets/tailwind/application.css
//          depend on. getAnimations() reads the timeline actually driving paint.
//
// MUTATION-PROVEN: revert playwright.config.js to the bare `reducedMotion:` key
// and both witnesses go red (measured — see the task's control line).
