 *
 * Why this is needed: e2e test contests are created OFF-CHAIN
 * (skip_onchain_callback in e2e/seed.rb), so none of these reach a deployed
 * turf-vault program. The real responses chainless are therefore:
 *   - update_username  → { success:false } (Vault#set_username / build_set_username raises)
 *   - messages#create  → { ok:true } with NO seeds_earned (grant deferred) → the
 *                        quest arrow RESETS to idle instead of going to the checkmark,
 *                        and the card never advances chat → newsletter.
 *   - newsletter#subscribe → succeeds, but hits the RPC for the grant first.
 * Stubbing returns the success payload the server emits AFTER a confirmed grant,
 * so the REAL client orchestration runs (completeQuest → quest-advance crossfade,
 * the arrow idle→spinner→checkmark, quest-success / newsletter-success modal
 * swaps, the web3 add-email capture) with zero devnet. We never assert on-chain
 * seed totals here — real on-chain seed coverage lives in e2e/devnet-smoke.spec.js.
 *
 * Mirrors the page.route interception pattern in e2e/rpc-mock.js
 * (setupOnchainMocks). Non-POST requests fall through (route.fallback) so any
 * GET on these paths still hits the real server.
