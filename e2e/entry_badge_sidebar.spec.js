// The navbar ✨ entry-token badge, in a browser.
//
// WHY THESE LIVE HERE AND NOT IN A RENDER TEST. Every tier the `ui-only` shape
// demands renders to a String, and all three things this file covers are
// invisible in the response bytes:
//   · the CONTACT SHADOW is a computed box-shadow painting onto the avatar. The
//     stylesheet read correct while it painted NOTHING — the knob that carries
//     it tied .legendary-badge on specificity and lost on source order, so it
//     resolved to the treatment's transparent default. A markup assertion could
//     not have seen that, and neither could a class-list one.
//   · CLICKING THE BADGE opens the settings sidebar — and it has to still be
//     open a beat later, because the panel closes on @click.outside and the
//     badge sits outside it. Markup cannot tell an open panel from one that
//     opened and shut in the same tick.
//   · the SIDEBAR CHIP tracks the live count through a window event, and it
//     mounts TWICE (the sidebar body renders into the desktop and the mobile
//     panel). Server markup shows the load-time number in both; only a browser
//     shows whether an update reaches them.
//
// The seeded e2e user holds ZERO entry tokens, so the badge and the chip both
// start hidden and are surfaced the way the app surfaces them — through
// updateNavTokens(), the same call the mint and consume paths make.
