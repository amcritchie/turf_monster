## Branding & Theme

- **Theme**: Dynamic — engine-generated CSS custom properties from 7 role colors (see `studio-engine/docs/NAVBAR_SETUP.md` plus this file's semantic-token notes)
- **Theme config**: `theme_primary = "#4BAF50"` (green), `theme_accent = "#8E82FE"` (violet) in `studio.rb`
- **Admin theme page**: `/admin/theme` — color editor + styleguide (from engine)
- **Primary**: `#4BAF50` Green — brand text, CTAs, buttons, nav hovers, money displays, balances, checkmarks, hold button idle state
- **Mint**: `#06D6A0` — win badges, contest status (open). Reserved for game mechanics (win), not general selection UI. NOT the hold button's success state any more (2026-08): confirming used to jump to mint/teal, a different hue from the button pressed, with a mint check that barely showed on it — it now brightens within the brand green and draws the check in white.
- **Accent**: `#8E82FE` Violet — scores, draft badges, `.btn-secondary`, Phantom wallet badge. NOT for CTA-intent elements (use `primary` instead). NOT for turf scores (use `primary`).
- **Primary for selection UI**: Selection count badges, cart slot borders, matchup selection rings/tints, turf score values, links, sort toggle active state, and FAB buttons all use `primary` (green), not mint or violet.
- **Warning**: `#FF7C47` Orange — warning states, `.btn-warning`
- **Negative**: Red (Tailwind default) — losses
- **Font**: Montserrat (all weights 400-900), stack `Montserrat, system-ui, sans-serif`. Since studio-engine 0.56.3 the face is VENDORED — self-hosted woff2 through the asset pipeline, no Google Fonts — and declared `font-display: optional`. **Design for the fallback face.** `optional` has no swap period: a face not ready inside the browser's block period is abandoned for that whole navigation, so any visitor on a cold cache reads the page in `system-ui`, which is narrower than Montserrat on macOS and wider on Linux. A layout that only fits in Montserrat's metrics is broken for real users, not just for CI. `e2e/vendored_font_fallback.spec.js` holds that line for the header: it asserts the vendored woff2 really resolve same-origin here, then re-measures containment with the face forced to the fallback and to a proven-wider one.
- **Logo**: Two files exist — `/public/logo.png` (1.3MB, used in layout navbar) and `/public/logo.jpeg` (272KB, used in auth pages). Both are the green monster mascot. Should be consolidated to one file.

### Semantic Tokens (required)
- **Surfaces**: Use `bg-page`, `bg-surface`, `bg-surface-alt`, `bg-inset` — never hardcode `bg-navy-*`
- **Text**: Use `text-heading`, `text-body`, `text-secondary`, `text-muted` — never hardcode `text-white` for headings or `text-gray-*` for body text
- **Borders**: Use `border-subtle`, `border-strong` — never hardcode `border-navy-*`
- **CSS var naming**: `--color-cta` / `--color-cta-hover` for singular CTA color. Full `--color-primary-{50..900}` palette with RGB variants for Tailwind `primary-*` utilities.
- **Tailwind config**: `primary` palette is dynamic from shared studio config (CSS vars). `warning` palette defined locally in `config/tailwind.config.js`. Safelist includes `bg`, `text`, `border`, `ring` utilities for brand colors.

### Tailwind Compilation Constraints
Tailwind emits only classes it can see during the build. Keep dynamic class names on a short leash:

- Prefer literal class strings in ERB and JS templates.
- If a class is assembled dynamically, add it to `config/tailwind.config.js` `safelist`.
- Theme role colors are already safelisted for `bg`, `text`, `border`, and `ring` utilities across the configured shades/opacities.
- `level-badge-*` classes are safelisted because ERB emits them dynamically.
- One-off static dimensions can stay inline when extracting a class would create noise or when a previously valid utility was purged.

### Public S3 and OG Assets
Open Graph images must use the `amazon_public` / `amazon_dev_public` Active Storage services. The private `amazon` services return signed URLs; social unfurlers cache image URLs long enough for signed links to expire. Public OG services return permanent S3 object URLs, and `OgImageAttachable` owns the per-environment service choice.

### Status Badges
`ApplicationHelper::CONTEST_BADGE_STYLES`, keyed by contest status — the pill on
contest cards and headers: mint=open, yellow=locked (DERIVED time-gate, not a
status — `Contest#locked?`), gray=settled, violet=pending, red=cancelled
(`Contest#cancelled?`, the `onchain_cancelled` boolean — also not a status).

### Live Board State Badge
A DIFFERENT badge from the one above: `ContestsHelper::LIVE_STATES`, the label +
dot beside the contest name on `/contests/:slug/live`, and the same string in the
tab `<title>`. Five states — Cancelled (red), Live (red + `animate-pulse`),
Concluded (orange), Final (gray), Not started (gray).

Fixed precedence: **cancelled → final → concluded → live → upcoming**. The order
is load-bearing, not cosmetic. `Contest#live?` is `locked? && !settled?` and
mentions neither cancellation nor conclusion, so both of those states satisfy
`live?` and would be swallowed by the `live` branch if asked later; and `settled?`
forces both `locked?` and `concluded?` true by definition, so `final` must be
asked before `concluded`. Two separate bugs have been filed against this helper
for exactly that class of miss — the full five-predicate state space, including
the combinations that are unreachable and why, is documented in the comment above
`LIVE_STATES` in `app/helpers/contests_helper.rb`. Read it before adding a state.

**Motion is reserved for `live`.** The pulsing dot means one thing — this contest
is in progress — so every terminal, finished, and not-yet state takes a solid dot.
Pinned end to end in `test/controllers/contest_live_state_test.rb`, which asserts
on rendered page output (label, `data-state`, dot class, `<title>`) rather than on
the helper's return value.

The badge is server-rendered at page load and does NOT self-correct:
`Contest::LiveBroadcast` replaces the games strip and focus panel, not the header,
so a contest whose state changes under a viewer keeps the label it was drawn with
until a reload.

## Button System

CSS component classes in `app/assets/tailwind/application.css`:
- `.btn` (base), `.btn-primary` (green/white), `.btn-secondary` (violet/white), `.btn-outline` (border/transparent), `.btn-warning` (orange/white), `.btn-danger` (red), `.btn-google` (white/hardcoded gray-700 — uses `color: #374151` for dark mode compat)
- Size modifiers: `.btn-sm`, `.btn-lg`
- Disabled state built into `.btn` base
- Combine: `class="btn btn-primary btn-lg w-full"`

## Component Classes
`.card`, `.card-hover`, `.input-field`, `.empty-state`, `.json-debug`, `.label-upper`, `.badge`, `.matchup-selected`

## Matchup Grid

`_turf_totals_board.html.erb` — two sort modes toggled via Alpine (`sortMode`/`sortDir`):

- **Game view** (default): Paired cards with "vs" divider (`color-mix` background), sorted by lowest turf score. Uses `_matchup_game_pair.html.erb` partial (locals: `left`, `right`, `locked`); the enclosing grid carries the `tm-pair-grid` hook so the sidebar-push companion rule can drop it to one column (see § Sidebar Primitive). Both-selected: outer `outline` + `box-shadow` glow in primary, "vs" div gets primary tint.
- **Turf Score view**: Flat grid (`tm-team-grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4` — the `tm-team-grid` hook is what lets the sidebar-push companion rule drop it back to two columns; see § Sidebar Primitive) of individual cards sorted by turf score. Uses `_matchup_card.html.erb` partial (local: `matchup`). Double-click "Turf Score" toggles asc/desc (arrow indicator). Two server-rendered orderings toggled via `x-show` (no JS re-sorting).
- Both views share the same Alpine `selections` state — selections persist across view switches.
- **Filter input**: Text input in the sort toolbar filters matchup cards by team name (both teams). Uses `matchesFilter()` Alpine method with `x-show` on wrapper divs. Clear X button appears when text is entered.

### Matchup Card Layout
Flag emoji (3xl) → Team name (bold, lg/xl) → Turf Score number (primary, 2xl/3xl, no prefix, integers without decimal) → "Points / Goal" label (singular "Point" when turf score is 1) → Game info line (tiny, both teams' emojis + short names, e.g. "🇪🇸 ESP vs CPV 🇨🇻"). Cards use `rounded-2xl`. Standalone cards have `w-full` to fill grid cells. Auto-shrink JS for long team names.

### `.matchup-selected` class
Uses `outline` (not border) for selection highlight — avoids layout shift. Dynamic primary color via `rgb(var(--color-primary-rgb))`. Includes `box-shadow` glow. Double-selected game pairs use inline `outline` + `box-shadow` on the wrapper div.

## Cart
- **Cart slot cards** (`_turf_totals_cart_slots.html.erb`): Emoji + Team Name + "vs OPP" on first line, "Goals" + turf score on second line.
- `pickOrder` array in Alpine state controls display order (insertion order)
- "Clear All" button clears selections locally + abandons entry server-side
- Blur overlay fires once per page load (`blurUsed` flag)

## Long-Press Button

**Owned by studio-engine since 0.56** (`studio/_hold_button` + `studio/_fizz_layer`,
`Studio::FizzHelper`, and the ACTION family in `engine-motion.css`). This app used to
carry its own copy of all four; `adopt-engine-hold-button` deleted them. Render it:

```erb
<%= render "studio/hold_button", hold_id: "desktop", duration: 2000, ... %>
```

- **Where it renders here**: the contest board's desktop + mobile cart (two DOM
  elements, differentiated by `hold_id`) and the entry-token modals
  (`modals/auth/_tokens`, `_paypal_tokens`).
- **Params, states, fizz levels, zones, the `--hold-*` theming inputs**: documented
  in the engine's CHANGELOG (0.56) and staged live on `/admin/style` → Tricks →
  "Hold to confirm". Do not re-document them here — a second copy of a spec drifts
  the same way a second copy of the CSS did.
- **The floor is real**: `Gemfile` pins `~> 0.56` and
  `test/lib/engine_pin_contract_test.rb` asserts it. Below 0.56 the partial does not
  exist and the board's confirm button raises on render rather than degrading.
- **Do not re-declare its classes locally.** Since **0.56.1** the engine ships
  `.hold-btn`, `.hold-stack`, `.fizz-bit` and `.nudge-debug` inside
  `@layer components`, and anything this app writes as `@utility` compiles into
  `@layer utilities` — a LATER layer in Tailwind v4's `theme, base, components,
  utilities` order, so the local copy WINS regardless of specificity. A local
  re-declaration is therefore not inert: it silently SHADOWS the engine primitive,
  and this button drifts from the `/admin/style` specimens with nothing in the
  engine having changed. (Before 0.56.1 the engine sheet was unlayered and the
  override lost instead. The hazard inverted; it did not go away — which is why
  the rule is "do not re-declare", not "re-declaring is harmless either way".)
  `test/lib/tailwind_css_dedupe_test.rb` guards the state names (`process`,
  `success`, `error`, `loading`, `nudge`, `nudge-soft`, `hold-icon`, `hold-text`,
  `fizz`, `hold-fizz`, `fizz-bit`); `.hold-btn`, `.hold-stack` and `.nudge-debug`
  are on you.

### What this app still owns
- **The palette.** `TeamColorsHelper#team_card_palette` yields `fizz_light` /
  `fizz_dark` / `fizz_alt` per team (the alt is the flourish where a team curates
  one — the Ravens' red, the Buccaneers' orange — else its dark). The board carries
  them into `matchupData` as `colorLight` / `colorDark` / `colorAlt`, and its
  `fizzPalette` getter maps the six picked teams onto the engine's eighteen
  `--fizz-c-*` slots, three per pick in pick order, bound with
  `fizz_bind: "fizzPalette"`. Each pick owns one zone, so the fizz re-dresses itself
  as picks change. Pinned by `test/integration/hold_button_fizz_palette_test.rb`
  (server half) and `e2e/board_fizz_palette.spec.js` (the colours actually painting).
- **The callbacks.** `guard`, `validate` / `validate_at`, `early_action`,
  `on_hold_start` and `on_success` are this app's expressions, evaluated against the
  board's Alpine scope.

### Hold Validation
Optional mid-hold validation via `validate`/`validate_at` params. `validate` is a JS expression returning `Promise<boolean>`, called at `validate_at` ms (default 1000). If false, hold aborts. Both buttons use `validate: "d.runHoldValidations()"` which checks geo-blocking (fresh `GET /geo/check`) then login status.

### Nudge Animation
JS-driven, big nudge at 3s then soft nudge every 10s. Resets on hold, soft-only after release. Engine-owned since 0.56.

## Pick Slot Animations
- `pick-pulse` (gentle glow, picks 3-4)
- `pick-pulse-shimmer` (glow + sweep, picks 2 and 5)
- `pick-pulse-urgent` (fast intense glow + scale + sweep, pick 5 after removal)
- `pickUrgent` flag set when going from 5→4 selections, cleared when reaching 5 again or clearing all

## Redirect Modal
When hold-to-confirm hits a blocker (geo-blocked, not logged in, insufficient funds), a centered modal appears with icon, title, message, progress bar countdown (5s), and CTA button. Hold button flips to red `.error` state ("Entry Blocked").
- Geo-blocked → "Location Restricted" → `/`
- Not logged in → "Log In Required" → `/signin`
- Insufficient funds → "Insufficient Funds" / "Top Up Wallet" → `/wallet`
- `showRedirectModal(title, message, icon, url, seconds, cta)` method on Alpine component

## Navbar

Extracted to `layouts/_navbar.html.erb` partial. Sticky, scroll-responsive. The non-preview header is `nav-shell vt-pinned-header sticky top-0 z-[var(--z-nav)] bg-page transition-shadow duration-300` — `--z-nav` deliberately sits below the shared modal host backdrop at `--z-modal`, so every modal covers persistent navigation chrome. Both come from the shared layer scale (see **Layer scale** below); the header also carries a z-index, which makes it a stacking context, so the environment bars render as a SIBLING above it rather than inside it.

### The collapse is scroll-LINKED, not a threshold plus a clock

The header carries `x-data="navCollapse()"` (factory in `shared/_alpine_factories.html.erb`). It publishes **one number, `--nav-p`** — collapse progress, `0` expanded to `1` collapsed — on the `<header>` itself, once per animation frame, from `window.scrollY`. `application.css` derives every collapsing dimension from it with `calc()`: row padding, logo size, title size, "Totals" size, balance size, username size. `--nav-p` is registered with `@property` as a `<number>`, which is what makes the `calc()`s legal, gives an untouched page a real `0`, and lets `/admin/navbar` transition it directly.

**Nothing on the collapse path carries a time-based transition.** `transition-shadow` on the header is the exception and may stay: `box-shadow` paints, it never reflows, so it cannot move content.

**What this replaced, and why.** The old build flipped an Alpine `scrolled` boolean at `scrollY > 60` (hysteresis back at `5`) and fed that step into `transition-all duration-300` on five layout properties at once — padding, logo `width`/`height`, and three font sizes. The finger set the step; an ease curve owned everything after it. Measured 2026-08-27 at 390×844:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| Header height, expanded → collapsed | 178px → 139px | unchanged (178px → 139px) |
| Content displacement after the finger STOPS | **34px over 232ms** | **0px** |
| Peak uncommanded content velocity | ~3px/frame (~180px/s) | 0 |
| Reverse (wrong-direction) lurch at the threshold | +1px | none |
| Peak content speed during the collapse | 2× the finger, stepping straight back to 1× | ~1.5×, easing out of and back into 1× |

**Why content speeds up at all.** Collapsing a sticky, *in-flow* header pulls the page up, so during the collapse content moves by the scroll **and** by the shrink — always faster than the finger. That is inherent; reclaiming the vertical space is the point. The design problem is the shape of the burst. `--nav-ramp` is **3× the band's collapse total** (mobile `120px`, desktop `144px`) and `navCollapse()` eases it with a smoothstep, whose slope is zero at both ends — so content speed leaves 1×, peaks near 1.5× mid-ramp, and returns to 1× with no velocity step at either end.

**Three details in `navCollapse()` that are load-bearing:**
- **passive + rAF** — the listener never blocks the compositor and coalesces a burst of scroll events (iOS momentum fires well above 60Hz) into one write per frame. The write lands on the header, **not `:root`**, so each frame's style recalc stays inside the navbar subtree.
- **the short-page guard** — collapsing shortens the document by `--nav-ramp`. On a page with barely more than that to scroll, the collapse deletes the very scroll room that triggered it, the browser clamps `scrollY` to 0, and the navbar flaps forever. `roomExpanded` adds back the shrink already applied so the measurement cannot chase itself; under `--nav-ramp + 24` the collapse is disabled outright.
- **reduced motion** — scroll-linked motion has no clock left to slow down, but resizing type under a moving finger is itself the motion some readers are asking us to drop. Under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, `--nav-p` snaps `0`/`1` on the old `60`/`5` hysteresis instead of interpolating.

`is-scrolled` (+ `shadow-lg border-b border-subtle`) is still class-toggled on the same hysteresis — it is the shadow only, and hysteresis keeps it from strobing at the boundary.

### Partial locals
- `show_logged_in` — override `logged_in?` (default: real session). Used by admin preview to force logged-in/out views.
- `preview` — drops `x-data`/`navCollapse()` and sticky positioning. It KEEPS `nav-shell` (the `--nav-p` `calc()`s have to resolve); `/admin/navbar` drives `--nav-p` from its own Scrolled toggle instead.

### Responsive breakpoints
`@layer utilities` in `app/assets/tailwind/application.css` (migrated out of an inline `<style>` block 2026-05-24), three tiers. Mobile title stacks "Turf"/"Totals" vertically via `flex-direction: column` with `-4px` bottom margin on "Turf" to tighten spacing. "Totals" renders larger than "Turf" on mobile.

Each band overrides the `--nav-*` custom properties on `.nav-shell`, so a band is *the two endpoints of its collapse*, not two separate rule sets. Endpoints are unchanged from the pre-2026-08-27 build; only the path between them is.

| Range | `--nav-ramp` | `.user-nav-col` | `.nav-logo` | `.nav-title` | `.nav-title span:last-child` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **< 400px** | 120px | 14rem | 3rem → 2.5rem | 1.1rem → 0.9rem | 1.3rem → 1rem |
| **400–767px** | 120px | 15rem | 3rem → 2.5rem | 1.25rem → 1rem | 1.5rem → 1.15rem |
| **768px+** | 144px | clamp(16rem, 24vw, 20rem) | 3rem → 2rem | 1.875rem → 1.25rem | — (tracks `.nav-title`) |

Row padding is `1.5rem → 0.5rem` in every band (`--nav-pad`, was `py-6`/`py-2`); balance is `1.25rem → 1.125rem` (`.nav-balance`, was `text-xl`/`text-lg`) and username `1.125rem → 1rem` (`.nav-username`, was `text-lg`/`text-base`). Both left Alpine's per-scroll reactive path when they moved onto `--nav-p`.

### Left side
Logo (`.nav-logo`) + "Turf Totals" brand title (`.nav-title` with two `<span>`s), desktop nav links (`hidden md:flex`: Contests, NFL Totals, Rules, Reserves, geo badge — `_navbar.html.erb:63-69`).

### Mobile sub-navbar
`flex md:hidden` compact row below main nav with `bg-surface-alt border-t border-subtle`. Contains: Contests, NFL Totals, Rules, Reserves, geo badge (`_navbar.html.erb:130-135`). Gear sidebar trigger + theme toggle morph pushed right via `ml-auto`.

### Environment banner
Owned by **studio-engine** (>= 0.30), not by this app: the markup lives in the gem at `app/views/studio/banners/_environment.html.erb`. Turf renders it from `app/views/layouts/_navbar.html.erb:45`, **inside** the sticky `<header>` (opened at `_navbar.html.erb:34`, closed at `:141`) — so it stays pinned with the navbar instead of scrolling away. Turf passes two locals and nothing else:

```erb
<%= render "studio/banners/environment",
           preview: is_preview,
           devnet: Solana::Config.devnet? %>
```

The partial decides for itself whether to appear, what to say, and whether the local inbox is linkable:

- **When it shows** — `!preview && Studio.show_environment_banner?` (gem `_environment.html.erb:29`). That is true in every environment except real production; a QA app runs Rails in production mode, so `QA_ENV` re-opens it there (gem `lib/studio/environment_banner.rb:30-34`). It is **not** conditional on `Solana::Config.devnet?`. `preview: true` — the admin navbar-review page — suppresses it so a preview copy can't duplicate live chrome.
- **What `devnet:` actually drives** — never visibility. It renders a `DEVNET` chip beside the buttons when `devnet && !qa`, and instead appends `Devnet` to the message when `devnet && qa` (gem `_environment.html.erb:21-22`).
- **Message** — `Studio.environment_banner_message`. Off QA it is **derived**, not a literal: `"#{rails_env.to_s.capitalize} Environment"`, which yields `"Development Environment"` in development (gem `environment_banner.rb:42`). On QA it is the fixed pair `"QA Environment · Non-production"`. Extra segments join with ` · ` (gem `environment_banner.rb:38-46`).
- **Colors** — `tone: :environment` in the shared `studio/banners/_app_banner`: a `linear-gradient(90deg, #9d174d 0%, #f72585 100%)` strip with `#ffffff` text and a `0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)` shadow (gem `_app_banner.html.erb:8-12`). Pink/magenta, applied as inline styles — not a Tailwind color utility.
- **Alignment** — the background is full-bleed (`w-full`), but the content is capped at `max-w-7xl mx-auto` and laid out `flex items-center justify-between`: message left (truncating), actions right. Nothing is horizontally centered — `items-center` aligns the row vertically (gem `_app_banner.html.erb:28-33`).
- **Actions**, in render order — the `DEVNET` chip (only when `devnet && !qa`), the `DEV MODE` toggle, then the `Email` status button (gem `_environment.html.erb:31-35`). Email links `/_studio/local_emails` only where that page actually answers; on QA it degrades to an inert status chip so the banner can never advertise a 404 (reachability is computed at gem `_email_status_button.html.erb:8-11`; the link-vs-inert-chip branch is at `:30-42`).

The DEV MODE toggle drives `$store.devMode` (see Dev Mode section).

### Geo badge
Rendered from the ENGINE's `components/_geo_badge` (studio-engine >= 0.57 — this app's fork was deleted in adopt-engine-geo-primitives) — shared by desktop nav and mobile sub-navbar. **Public: renders for every visitor, signed in or not** — detection is IP-based (`Studio::GeoDetection#detect_geo_state` runs on every request), and lookups are cached in `Rails.cache` for 24h keyed by IP (the engine configures Geocoder on boot) so the anonymous ipinfo tier's shared rate limit doesn't blank the state into a red `??`. Shows flag + state code when resolved; red `??` when undetectable (fail-closed); red when blocked or a geo override is active. Stable selector: `.geo-badge`. State flags ship as gem assets (`state-flags/<code>.svg`), so the `src` is an asset path rather than a `public/` one; the image uses inline styles for reliable sizing (`height: 12px; width: 16px; object-fit: cover`). Badge shape is `rounded-lg`.

### Right side — logged in: two-row block + avatar
- **Row 1 (Div 1)**: balance, gear + theme toggle morph (left of username, `hidden md:flex`), username. On mobile, gear + morph shown in sub-navbar instead. `padding-right: 6px` via inline style.
- **Row 2 (Div 2)**: 5-section seeds progress bar via `render "components/seeds_bar", compact: true` (turf-vault v0.9.0+ refactor — replaced the old `.seeds-bar`/`.seeds-fill`/`.seeds-text` classes). The partial uses the `.seeds-bar-continuous` class + CSS-registered `--bar-progress` custom property so all 5 segment widths interpolate from a single transition (one ease curve, not 5 chained). Per-section shimmer overlays positioned in bar coordinates (`left: -(i-1)*100%, width: 500%`) keep the wave continuous across segments. Wallet address (left) + Level X (right) overlaid via two-layer clip-path text technique (muted underneath, white on top revealed by `clip-path: inset(0 (100-displaySeeds)% 0 0)`). Level-up: `bar → 100% → bump level (.nav-level-pop) → drain → refill`. Listens for `navbar-replay-level` and `navbar-seeds-update` window events.
- **Avatar**: `_avatar.html.erb` partial (size "nav" = `w-8 h-8`), outside the two-row block. Links to `/account`.
- Balance shows whole dollars only (no cents) — JS hydrate (`refreshSession`/`refreshBalance`) uses `Math.floor`, ERB uses `.to_i`. The pill is **USDC + USDT combined** (`display_balance`); per-currency readouts live on `/account`'s `data-wallet-tile` tiles. The link hides while the cache is cold ("loading"); when the combined balance is $0 with free-entry tokens present the slot swaps the amount for a "✨ Free Entry" label (see § Entry Tokens (Web2 flow)).
- Username and balance link to `/account` and `/wallet` respectively. Both use `transition-all duration-300` for smooth scroll-responsive font-size changes.
- **Username overflow fade**: `.username-cap` class sets responsive `max-width` (5rem tiny, 6rem small, 7rem desktop). When text overflows, Alpine applies a CSS `mask-image` gradient to fade the trailing edge. Overflow is recalculated when the navbar review page's username input changes.
- User nav column has `pl-0 pr-4 md:px-4` — no left padding on mobile.

### Right side — logged out
- Theme toggle morph (`hidden md:flex`) + a **"Sign in"** button, right-aligned. Theme toggle morph appears in mobile sub-navbar instead.
- The button is `class="btn btn-primary"` — the theme's primary color, not a hardcoded green.
- It is a **modal trigger, not a navigation**: `@click.prevent` opens the in-page auth modal via `$store.modals.open('auth', { step: 'credentials', mode: 'signup', … })`. The `signin_path` href is only the no-JS fallback. Login and signup are one create-or-login flow, so the single CTA reads "Sign in" while opening at `mode: 'signup'` (`_navbar.html.erb:118-124`).

## Theme Toggle Morph (Spinner Swap)

`components/_theme_toggle_morph.html.erb` (engine partial) — dark mode toggle and loading spinner share the same 16x16 space. Two absolutely-positioned elements with `transition-all duration-300` cross-fade via `transform: scale() rotate()` + `opacity`.

- **Default state**: Toggle visible (`scale(1) rotate(0deg) opacity(1)`), spinner hidden (`scale(0) rotate(-90deg) opacity(0)`)
- **Loading state**: Toggle hidden, spinner visible — triggered by `showNavSpinner()` global function
- **After loading**: Spinner hides, toggle returns — triggered by `hideNavSpinner()` with 2.5s minimum display time

**Global JS** (in engine `_head.html.erb`): `showNavSpinner()` records `Date.now()`, `hideNavSpinner()` calculates remaining time from the 2.5s minimum and uses `setTimeout` to delay the hide. Both target `.nav-toggle-icon` and `.nav-spinner-icon` class elements.

**Usage**: Gear sidebar "Refresh Wallet" calls `showNavSpinner(); refreshSession().finally(function() { hideNavSpinner(); })` (refreshSession is the full navbar hydrate — balance + tokens + seeds + wallet tiles). Auto-refresh on devnet uses the same pattern.

## Leaderboard (Contest Show)
Selection badges are fixed-width (`w-28`), sorted by game kickoff time, showing turf score (e.g., `x3`) before game completes and points (goals x turf score) after. Badges float right with score rightmost (`min-width: 4.5rem`). Non-integer values show decimal portion in smaller font. Payout label (`$40.00`) appears on left (after player name) only before settling. Admin payout button says "Payout $X". After settling — paid rows get primary ring, divider line after last paid position, unpaid rows dimmed. Rank column shows actual rank (from entry.rank) when settled.

## Faucet Page (`/faucet`)
Public marketing page with hero, "How It Works" cards, and USDC claim form. Mints SPL USDC tokens directly to user's Phantom wallet via `Vault#mint_spl(to: wallet)`. Three view states: wallet connected (amount picker + claim), logged in no wallet (connect CTA), logged out (login/signup CTAs). Preset amounts $10/$50/$100/$500, custom input $1-$500.

## Modal Host (studio-engine v0.4.5+)

Modal lifecycle is owned by the studio-engine modal host — `Alpine.store('modals')` — a stack-based store provided by the engine's `studio/modals/_host.html.erb` partial. Local app code consumes the store; do not reimplement.

**This app no longer forks the host** (2026-08-28, `defork-turf-modal-host`). It used to:
studio-engine is **non-isolated**, so an app view at the same path wins the lookup, and this
app shipped its own `app/views/studio/modals/_host.html.erb` — 518 lines that rendered the
same markup as the engine's while quietly falling behind its focus and stale-entry guards.
A gem bump delivered no host fix at all, and nothing on a page could tell the two apart.
That file is deleted. The engine's host renders, and a gem bump now reaches it.

**Prove which host renders by RESOLUTION, never by path.** Both files lived at the same
virtual path, so a `File.read` of a fixed path answers a different question than it appears
to — which is exactly how the duplication survived. Ask the resolver:

```ruby
ApplicationController.new.lookup_context.find("host", ["studio/modals"], true).identifier
```

Assert it does **not** start with `Rails.root.join("app/views")`. Do **not** assert it
contains `/gems/`: that encodes how the engine happens to be installed here and can never
pass in studio-engine's own consumer-CI lane, which bundles the engine as a path checkout.
`test/support/resolved_modal_host.rb` wraps this; `test/views/modal_host_adoption_test.rb`
pins it, and `test/integration/modal_host_focus_contract_test.rb` reads the RESOLVED host
so the focus contract stays asserted against whatever a page actually gets — a re-fork or
an engine downgrade under the `~> 0.64` pin both re-open the gap silently.

**Two consumer seams, so nothing has to fork this file again** (studio-engine 0.65.0):

| Seam | Where it lives here | What it carries |
|---|---|---|
| `window.StudioModals.CARD_WIDTHS` | `app/views/shared/_modal_card_widths.html.erb` | per-modal card width by id (`wallet-setup` → `max-w-md`) |
| `modals/_host_extras` | `app/views/modals/_host_extras.html.erb` | app-wide modal registrations (`cosign-rejected`) |

The width partial **must render ABOVE the host** in every layout that mounts it — the host
merges the map at the top of its own inline script, so a registration that arrives later is
read by nobody and every card silently falls back to `max-w-sm`. A layout that mounts the
host without it fails `modal_host_adoption_test.rb`.

The `ModalAnimations` registry (`pop` / `shake` / `slide`, and the keyframes behind them) is
engine-owned too, and consumer entries merge OVER the engine defaults the same way. This
app registers none — its fork's registry was byte-identical to the engine's defaults, which
is why adopting the host changed no animation.

**Opening / closing**:

```js
$store.modals.open('id', { props })   // push { id, props } onto stack, lock body scroll
$store.modals.close()                  // pop the top modal
$store.modals.closeAll()               // empty the stack
$store.modals.current()                // top modal { id, props } or null
$store.modals.isOpen('id')             // membership check
```

The stack is LIFO — multiple modals can be open simultaneously and render as a Z-indexed stack. Each modal's `props` persists across re-renders, perfect for multi-step flows (tokens → confirm → success).

**Dismissibility**: Modals are dismissible by default (Escape + click outside). For on-chain TX flows, set `dismissible: false` on the props so an accidental click can't orphan a signed-but-unconfirmed transaction. Close only via `$store.modals.close()`.

**Defining a new modal partial**: mount it inside `<template x-if="$store.modals.current().id === 'your-id'">`, then pick where it is REGISTERED:

- **Belongs to a page or a call site** (needs `logged_in?`, a feature flag, or helper-computed locals) — register it in **BOTH** layout blocks, because there are two and forgetting the second is the usual slip:
  1. `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` — the app.
  2. `app/views/layouts/modal_preview.html.erb` — the `/admin/modals/preview` gallery.
- **Belongs to the APP** (no locals, no per-layout gating) — put it in `app/views/modals/_host_extras.html.erb` instead. The engine host renders that partial inside the card on every path through it, so one entry covers both layouts and cannot drift. `cosign-rejected` is the current occupant.

Both layout lists are long; grep either for `store.modals.current` to find where they start. (Deliberately no line numbers or counts here — this section previously pointed at a partial that had not existed for months, and precise-but-rotting coordinates are how that happens.) Note that a test scanning a LAYOUT's source for a registration cannot see a `_host_extras` one — `test/controllers/onboarding_gallery_test.rb` does exactly that, so widen it there if you move one of its ids.

A modal registered only in (1) works in the app and is silently missing from the preview gallery, which is where it gets reviewed. **What the gallery cannot show**: at `/admin/modals/preview/<id>` the host backdrop computes `position: static` with no body scroll lock, while the identical element on a real app page computes `fixed` + `overflow: hidden` (measured back-to-back in one browser context, same CSS digests; cause not isolated). Trust the gallery for content and theme, never for production overlay geometry — clipping bugs are invisible there. **Critical: single root element** — sibling `<style>` / `<script>` / structural tags are silently dropped during parsing (see § Alpine + ERB Constraints below).

**Recovery**: The host auto-clears the stack on browser back navigation (bfcache `pageshow`) and Turbo navigation (`turbo:before-cache`). No app-side recovery code needed.

**Slow-op smoothing**: `window.StudioModals.holdAtLeast(minMs)` returns a thenable enforcing a minimum spinner duration — pair with the processing card so the spinner doesn't flash past the user on fast operations.

> The old `Alpine.store('solanaModal')` is now a thin compatibility proxy over `$store.modals`. New code should call `$store.modals` directly. `fireSuccessConfetti()` still lives in `solana_utils.js` (the old "in wallet_connect" claim was always wrong).

## Auth Modal — 8-step state machine

`/modals/_auth.html.erb` is a single Alpine component that branches on an 8-step state machine. State lives on `$store.modals.current().props.step`, mutated by the board's `selectionBoard` component.

**Step sequence + transitions**:

1. **credentials** — initial state. Phantom + Google + magic-link email form. Local validation. Submits via `$dispatch('auth-*-submit')` / `$dispatch('auth-*-click')`.
2. **tokens-picker** — Stripe pack grid (via `_tokens.html.erb`). Click opens Stripe Checkout in a new tab. Sets step → `tokens-waiting`.
3. **tokens-waiting** — Spinner + "Finish checkout in the new tab" message. No countdown; user returns manually.
4. **tokens-confirming** — Processing card (spinner + "Confirming…"). Waits for the polling loop on `/tokens/status` to mark the purchase `minted`.
5. **tokens-minted** — Success card: "Entry Token Minted" + balance display + in-modal Hold-to-Confirm button. The hold fires `'hold-confirm-entry'`; the board's listener detects auth-modal context and stays in the modal → step `tokens-submitted`.
6. **tokens-submitted** — `entry_confirmed` card (seeds bar + explorer link + leaderboard CTA). Auto-redirects to the contest or fallback.
7. **tokens-error** — Poll timed out or entry submission failed. Error card with "Refresh" button.
8. **redirect** — Geo-blocked / not logged in / insufficient funds. Countdown + CTA to the blocker's target page (e.g. `/wallet`). Driven by the board's `setInterval`.

**Stripe integration**: Pack cards trigger `POST /tokens/stripe_checkout` → opens checkout in a new tab → buyer returns to `/tokens/processing?session_id=…` → page polls `GET /tokens/status` every 500ms until `ready: true`. Backend: webhook → `TokenPurchaseJob` → mints incrementally via `Vault#mint_entry_token`. Job is idempotent — tracks `already_minted` count, resumes from the next index on retry. See § Entry Tokens (Web2) below.

**In-modal hold-to-confirm**: The button in the `tokens-minted` step dispatches `'hold-confirm-entry'`. The board's listener routes confirmation through `ContestsController#enter` with the token path (consumes one token via `Vault#enter_contest_with_token` — no USDC charge). On success the modal stays open and swaps to `tokens-submitted`.

## Real-time Chat (ActionCable)

Contest chat ships in `_chat_panel.html.erb` with **Turbo Streams over ActionCable**. The panel establishes a per-contest subscription via `<%= turbo_stream_from contest, :messages %>`. Posts and deletions broadcast directly from the `Message` model.

**Broadcast wiring**:

```ruby
# app/models/message.rb (sketch)
after_create_commit do
  broadcast_prepend_to([contest, :messages],
    target: "contest_#{contest_id}_messages",
    partial: "messages/message",
    locals:  { message: self })
rescue => e
  ErrorLog.capture!(e)   # best-effort — never fail a committed HTTP request
end

after_update_commit :broadcast_removal, if: :saved_change_to_hidden_at?
```

**Pinned composer, newest-first stream**: Form wrapper uses `flex flex-shrink-0` to stay pinned. Messages render in a flex column with newest at top. New messages prepend and animate via `@keyframes chat-message-in` (slide + fade, 0.34s cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)). A `MutationObserver` watches for new `#message_*` nodes and applies the animation class.

**Permission gate**: Read is public. Post requires `logged_in? && contest.chat_enabled? && contest.chat_participant?(current_user)`. Server-side helpers control composer display (input vs "log in" vs "enter contest to chat"). `MessagesController#create` re-checks `chat_participant?` before persisting. Delete is admin-only.

**Admin hide buttons**: The `.chat-admin-only` CSS class is `display: none` by default; revealed only when the root `.chat-admin` class is present (added server-side via `<%= 'chat-admin' if current_user&.admin? %>`). Hide buttons fire `hideChatMessage(btn)` which `DELETE`s the message via `data-message-url`, triggering broadcast removal.

**"Live" indicator**: Radar-ping animation (`@keyframes chat-live-ping`) — a repeating scale+fade ring (1 → 2.6, opacity 0.6 → 0, 1.8s) layered behind a solid green dot.

**Quest 2 composer nudge**: While the "Send Your First Message" mission is showing (`contests/_quest_chat`), the composer answers the quest card's southwest arrow with two cues, both driven by the one `quest-chat-active` window event `questCard#_maybePingChat` dispatches — and which `focusChat()` re-dispatches on ANY click of the quest card. `contestChat#questChatActive()` pops the panel, sets `questGlow` (binds `.chat-input-glow` — a border + box-shadow pulse on the `<textarea>` itself, since a form control carries no `::before`/`::after` for the `.studio-border-glow` primitive), and starts the placeholder typewriter. The deck comes from `ContestsHelper#chat_prompt_samples`, rendered per-viewer into `data-chat-prompts` and gated on `@quest_step` (only `contests#show` sets it; `contests#live` renders no quest card, so it builds no deck). It is SEMI-STATIC: two fixed openers (`Hey everyone 👋`, `Good luck, everyone ⚔️`) then one personal line naming the viewer's longest-priced pick (`"<name> light it up <team emoji>"`, highest `turf_score` — the curve pins rank 1 at x1.0, so the biggest multiplier is the biggest swing). Two separate things keep the rested line readable, and it is worth not confusing them. The INVARIANT is CSS: `.chat-composer::placeholder` sets `white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis`, so an over-long placeholder CLIPS to one line instead of wrapping into a 22px box built for a 20px line and being sliced through its glyphs (measured: `scrollHeight` 76 vs `clientHeight` 38). It is scoped to `::placeholder` deliberately — the same rule on the element would stop TYPED text wrapping, a real regression for a 500-character composer. The COPY BUDGET is separate and softer: `CHAT_PROMPT_NAME_BUDGET` (10) falls back to `short_name` then `CHAT_PROMPT_NO_TEAM` so real names render in full rather than clipped. Treat the character count as a weak proxy for width — the content box is 206px in Chrome on macOS but 183px on the Linux CI runner (classic scrollbar vs overlay), and length barely tracks width anyway ("Commanders", 10 chars, measures 172.1px; "United States", 13 chars, measures 173.5px). `e2e/quest_chat_prompts.spec.js` asserts the wrap invariant for every budget-surviving name plus one deliberately oversize probe, and checks width only for the line actually rendered.

The deck size IS the pass count (`CHAT_PROMPT_LIMIT`, 3): the composer types each line in turn and then RESTS on the last one instead of looping. **Rest is terminal and needs its own flag** — `_promptsRested`, not the `_promptTimer` handle, which `_promptStep()` nulls when it rests; guarding on the handle let a second `quest-chat-active` re-enter at phase `hold`, erase the rested line, walk the index off the end of the deck and leave a permanently empty placeholder. Typing steps over CODE POINTS, never string indexes — slicing mid-emoji paints a lone surrogate. The textarea carries a static `aria-label`, because a placeholder that rewrites itself cannot serve as an accessible name. Both cues retire when a message sends (`questDone()`, on any successful post — not only the seeds-earning one — and it latches `_questOver` so a later ping cannot re-arm the glow); the typewriter alone also stops on the first keystroke (`$watch('body')` → `stopPrompts()`, which does not touch the glow) and never starts under `prefers-reduced-motion`, where the halo still renders without its pulse.

**Scroll fade**: Message list container uses `-webkit-mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #000 calc(100% - 2.5rem), transparent)` to soften the bottom edge.

## Entry Tokens

Entry tokens are on-chain `EntryTokenAccount` PDAs minted via Stripe Checkout. Buying tokens with a card lets a user with no USDC enter contests.

**Both wallet modes spend them** (2026-08-21). The BUY flow below is the managed/web2 one, and so is `ContestsController#enter` → `Vault#enter_contest_with_token`. The Phantom path reaches the same instruction from the other side: `#prepare_entry` builds `enter_contest_with_token` when the signing wallet holds an unconsumed token — the wallet itself signs the consume — and `#confirm_onchain_entry` cosigns and verifies against the token PDA the server recorded on the `PendingTransaction`. Before that wiring a Phantom wallet holding a token was still charged USDC, which is what made the board's "Hold for Free Entry" copy false for web3 (PR #386).

**The board CTA reads this rail.** `contests/_turf_totals_board` binds the hold button's idle label to `$store.session.tokensAvailable`: the wallet that can sign in the active session reads "Hold for Free Entry" when it holds a token; any other state reads "Hold to Confirm". Combo accounts use the managed address in web2 sessions and the Phantom address in web3 sessions, matching the server's funding choice. Both entry-success branches lower the client count through `mirrorTokenSpend()` when the server reports `token_consumed`; crash recovery invalidates the same token caches even when the entry was already activated. The CTA names the funding; the server chooses it.

**Full flow**:

1. User picks a pack in the auth modal's `tokens-picker` step.
2. `POST /tokens/stripe_checkout` creates a Stripe session (quantity / price / metadata with `user_id`, `wallet`, optional `contest` context).
3. New tab opens Stripe Checkout → buyer completes payment.
4. Stripe redirects to `/tokens/processing?session_id=…`.
5. Page polls `GET /tokens/status` every 500ms. Initial response: `{ ready: false, minted: 0, balance: X }`.
6. **Backend**: Stripe webhook → `TokenPurchaseJob.perform_later(...)`. Job mints one-by-one via `Vault#mint_entry_token`, persisting signatures to `StripePurchase.mint_tx_signatures` after each successful mint (incremental — crash recovery via resume point).
7. Once all quantities minted, `purchase.mark_minted!(signatures)` flips status → `"minted"`. `TransactionLog` records the purchase.
8. Poll detects `ready: true` → swaps the modal to `tokens-confirming` → user sees success card with balance + in-modal hold button.
9. Hold completes → `ContestsController#enter` routes to the token path → `Vault#enter_contest_with_token` consumes one token → entry confirms (seeds awarded). Modal swaps to `tokens-submitted` and auto-redirects.

**Operator claw-back — burning a token** (2026-09-06). `/admin/free_entries` pairs its Mint buttons with `Burn 1` and `Burn all N`, routed at `POST /admin/free_entries/:user_slug/burn` (`count` optional; absent burns everything unspent). The controls key off **unconsumed**, not `owed` — those point in opposite directions, so a row can offer both — and both are hidden on a cold cache for the same reason Mint is: never aim an irreversible action at an unverified count. There is deliberately **no** `burn_all` across all users to mirror `mint_all`; over-minting costs rent, over-burning destroys property for every account at once.

**The confirmed number is a ceiling.** Burn-all POSTs the *displayed* count, not a bare "burn everything". The row's `unconsumed` is cache-first (up to 60s stale, and the page never auto-refreshes), while the controller re-reads the chain live — so sending no count let it fall through to the live figure, and a token minted between render and click (level-up sweep, a completed `TokenPurchaseJob`, another admin's "Mint All Owed") was destroyed by an operator who agreed to a smaller number. With the count sent, `count.clamp(0, burnable.length)` makes the confirmed figure a maximum: burn everything you saw, never more, and fewer if some were spent meanwhile. Both burn buttons are `btn-danger` — `--color-cta` and `--color-success` resolve to the same green, so `btn-outline` here was indistinguishable from the benign "Act as" and, on hover, from "Mint".

**It inherits the page's wallet blindness.** `User#solana_address` is `web3 || web2`, so for a combo account only the Phantom wallet's tokens are counted and burnable — a web2-owned token is neither shown nor clawed back. Mint already had this and the burn exposure is no wider, but a claw-back workflow that silently misses half a combo user's tokens is worth knowing before you promise someone their balance is cleared.

The on-chain half is `turf-vault`'s new `burn_entry_token` (1-of-3 vault signer; the holder does **not** sign, because a claw-back is aimed exactly at a holder who will not surrender the token). Two design points are load-bearing and easy to get wrong:

- **It tombstones, it does not close.** `owed` is `(seeds / SEEDS_PER_LEVEL) - tokens.length`, read off the chain here *and* in `Tokens::LevelUpGrant#missing_levels`. Closing the PDA would drop `tokens.length`, so a burned token would re-read as owed and be re-minted by the page's own `Mint all` or the next level-up sweep — the burn would undo itself. The account survives (rent is not refunded); that is the price of a burn that sticks.
- **The tombstone rides in the spare high bit of `source`** (`ENTRY_TOKEN_BURNED_FLAG = 0x80`), not in a new field. `EntryTokenAccount` is 124 bytes and fully packed; growing the struct would break `Account<EntryTokenAccount>` deserialization for every token minted before the upgrade, taking `enter_contest_with_token` down with it for those holders. A burn sets `consumed = true` (which is what actually blocks the spend, reusing the constraint that instruction already carried) **and** the flag (which is what tells a claw-back apart from a genuine redemption). `Vault#decode_entry_token` splits the byte once — `source` is masked, `burned` is a new key — so no caller sees the raw value.

**Job idempotency**: `TokenPurchaseJob` short-circuits if `status == "minted"` (already done). On retry it calculates `already_minted` from the persisted signature count and loops from there — exactly-once per token even with mid-job crashes.

**Navbar badge**: free-entry tokens are surfaced by the ✨ badge tucked into the profile avatar's upper-left corner in `_user_nav` (`[data-free-entry-badge]`, count in `data-token-count`, toggled by `updateNavTokens`). It is absolutely positioned, so it costs the row no width whether or not the user holds a token. When the combined USDC+USDT balance is $0 AND the user has tokens, the balance slot (`[data-balance-slot]`) swaps its `$X` amount for the "✨ Free Entry" label (`[data-free-entry-label]`, `.is-active`) rather than hiding the balance — one rule, `applyBalanceSlotRule()` in `solana_utils.js`, shared by the server render, `refreshBalance`, and `updateNavTokens`, so the two halves cannot drift. Hovering or focusing the badge peeks that same label over the amount (`.fe-peek`, driven by `freeEntryHover` in the `_user_nav` Alpine scope); a level-up glows the badge (`.free-entry-glow`, armed by `window.armFreeEntryGlow`).

**Badge paint**: the disc wears `.legendary-badge` — the house legendary treatment (a gradient far wider than the element, panned under it, white rim, warm bloom), built like the engine's `.level-badge-10` but in the app's own primary + warning rather than a fixed 8-stop rainbow. It is PAINT ONLY: the caller brings width, radius and font-size, and `--lb-a` / `--lb-b` / `--lb-contact` are knobs. `--lb-contact` is the dark contact shadow the disc casts onto the avatar it overlaps, set by `.free-entry-badge.legendary-badge` — a compound (0,2,0) that out-ranks the treatment's own transparent default wherever it sits. It began as a bare `.free-entry-badge` rule ABOVE the treatment, which ties `.legendary-badge` on specificity and loses on source order, so the shadow resolved to nothing while the stylesheet still read correct. POSITION is what fixed it; the compound is what keeps it fixed through a reorder. Both halves are pinned by `test/views/entry_token_badge_placement_test.rb`.

**Badge click**: opens the settings sidebar (`$store.sidebars.gearOpen`) — the same target the avatar and username toggle. It does NOT pop a menu of its own. The count it once showed in a short-lived popover now lives in the sidebar the click opens: `components/_gear_sidebar` renders a `[data-free-entry-chip]` pill in the same `.legendary-badge` treatment, reading "✨ N Free Entr{y,ies}". That chip mounts TWICE — the sidebar body renders into both the desktop and the mobile panel — so it stays live through the `entry-tokens-updated` window event (the `entryTokenBadge` factory) rather than a `querySelector` sync, which would update one panel and strand the other. It hides at zero, with `display:none` pre-set server-side so there is no pre-Alpine flash.

The markup halves of those three ARE assertable from the response bytes, and `test/views/entry_token_badge_placement_test.rb` asserts them — the chip in both mounts, its server-set `display:none`, the knob below the treatment. What no string can see is the paint and the timing, so `e2e/entry_badge_sidebar.spec.js` guards those in a browser: it asserts the shadow by neutralising `--lb-contact` and watching the PIXELS move (freezing the gradient pan with `emulateMedia` first — belt-and-braces now that `playwright.config` sets `reducedMotion` through `contextOptions`, and kept because this spec's whole result rests on the disc being still), the panel still open a beat after the click, and the chip following the count across both mounts.

## State Fanout Pattern

`app/javascript/state_fanout.js` is the standardized bridge from a server-confirmed state change to client UI catch-up. Controllers and inline Alpine handlers should call:

```js
window.StateFanout.apply(stateType, payload, opts)
```

A handler owns three things for its state type:

1. Durable client cache updates, usually `localStorage`, when the next page render needs the value.
2. Window events for long-lived Alpine components that should animate without a page reload.
3. Structured console logging with a `source` label so Sentry breadcrumbs and replay tools can connect the server action to the UI update.

Registered handlers:

| State type | Payload | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `seeds` | `{ seeds_earned, seeds_total, seeds_level? }` | Updates `seedsNavbar`, records `seedsLevelUp` when the user crosses a level, and dispatches `navbar-seeds-update`. |
| `cdp_ramp` | `{ direction, status, partner_user_ref, tx_hash?, sent_signature? }` | Refreshes the navbar balance for moved funds and dispatches `cdp-ramp-update`. |

When adding a state type, write one handler with `register(stateType, handler)` and keep all call sites on `window.StateFanout.apply(...)`. Pass constants such as `seedsPerLevel` through `opts`; do not hardcode model constants in client code.

## $store.session — wallet-mode pattern

Session state (guest / web2 / web3) is the canonical source of truth for what the user can do. **Always branch on `$store.session.mode === 'web3'`** — never on legacy `cfg.onchain_session`, never on `phantom_linked` alone.

**Server-side**: `ApplicationController#wallet_context` builds a `SessionContext` (PORO at `app/models/session_context.rb`) from `current_user` + `@onchain_session` flag (true when the user authenticated via a live Phantom signature *this session* — separate from account-level `phantom_linked?`). Serialized to a JSON block on every page:

```erb
<script type="application/json" id="session-context">
  <%= session_context.to_h.to_json.html_safe %>
</script>
```

**Client-side**: Alpine registers the store on `alpine:init` by parsing `#session-context`. Re-seeded on every Turbo load:

```js
Alpine.store('session', JSON.parse(document.getElementById('session-context').textContent))
```

Store shape (camelCase): `{ loggedIn, mode, phantomLinked, userId, address }`.

**Modes**:

- **`:guest`** — not logged in. Use `$store.session.loggedIn === false` to gate (login button visibility, etc.).
- **`:web2`** — logged in via email/Google OR Phantom-linked account that re-auth'd via email this session. CANNOT sign on-chain TXs. Stripe / faucet OK; Solana TX buttons disabled.
- **`:web3`** — logged in AND authenticated via a fresh Phantom signature. CAN sign on-chain TXs (contest creation, treasury cosigns, on-chain entry).

UI branching example:

```html
<button x-show="$store.session.mode === 'web3'" @click="signTx()">Sign on-chain</button>
<a     x-show="!$store.session.loggedIn"        href="/signin">Log in</a>
<div   x-show="$store.session.mode === 'web2'">Connect Phantom to sign</div>
```

## Landing Pages (funnel + referral attribution)

Landing pages are `LandingPage` records (name, headline, subheadline, badge, cta_label, background_style, contest_id, slug, active). Rendered at `/landing/:slug` by `LandingPagesController#show`. Page sections:

1. Hero — brand logo + two-tone "Turf Totals" title (split-color rendering).
2. Badge — optional `lp-badge` span (violet/20 background).
3. Contest snapshot card — entry fee / guaranteed prizes / entries count / lock time / CTA → `/contests/:id`.
4. "How it Works" — 4 numbered steps from `funnel_how_it_works(@contest)` helper, format-specific (Turf Totals vs World Cup Survivor copy).
5. Footer — context-aware ("See how it works" vs "Help Center").

**Background variants**: `background_partial` returns one of three animated partials (gradient / blobs / circles) based on `background_style` enum. Each is pure CSS — no JS.

**Referral capture (`?ref=` + cookies)**: `ApplicationController#capture_reference` runs before every action and writes `?reference=` into `cookies[:reference]` (30-day, first-touch wins). On signup, `RegistrationsController#create` mirrors the cookie to `user.reference`. `LandingPagesController#show` ALSO sets the cookie to the landing page's slug if empty (landing page as referrer). `LandingPage#signup_count` returns `User.where(reference: slug).count` for analytics.

**`/account/set_inviter`**: After signup, JS `POST /account/set_inviter?inviter_slug=…` (inviter's slug from landing context). `AccountsController#set_inviter` atomically sets `invited_by_id` (idempotent — 200 if already set). Builds the referral chain for leaderboard attribution.

## Alpine + ERB Constraints (critical — silent failures)

These are gotchas that produce **silent no-ops or phantom DOM** rather than errors. Every UI-touching change must respect them. Keep this neutral doc as the app-level source of truth; mirror cross-app lessons into McRitchie Studio's agent docs when they apply beyond Turf Monster.

1. **`<template x-if>` must have ONE root element.** Multiple siblings silently mount as a no-op; sibling `<style>` / `<script>` are dropped during parsing. Wrap content in a single outer `<div>`; move styles outside the template.
2. **Never combine `@click.outside` with hold buttons.** Button-release fires AFTER `@click.outside`, so a hold that opens a modal via `@click.outside` will have the release click close the freshly-opened modal. Use `@click`, or delay the open via `setTimeout(500ms)`.
3. **`<%# %>` ERB comments terminate at the FIRST `%>` anywhere in the body.** Comment bodies must contain ZERO `%` characters (including CSS `calc(... 100% ...)` snippets quoted inside). Use HTML `<!-- ... -->` for multi-line notes, or split into multiple `<%# %>` blocks.
4. **Never mix `<!--` (HTML) with `%>` (ERB) comment closes.** Mismatched open/close triggers HTML parser recovery → phantom DOM elements with mangled attributes (`x-show="null"`) on unrelated siblings. Match the syntax.
5. **HTML5 forbids `--` inside `<!-- ... -->`** — including CSS custom property refs (`--color-primary`) in dev notes. Parser recovery reparents downstream content into wrong containers. Use single hyphens or `−`, or move var refs to a `<style>` block.
6. **`block_given?` inside a partial inherits the layout's `<%= yield %>`** — returns true even with no block passed. Calling `yield` then returns the entire enclosing view's HTML. In shared partials, check explicit locals BEFORE `block_given?`: `if locals[:block] || block_given?`.
7. **Alpine's GENERATED DOM must not reach Turbo's page cache.** Turbo snapshots the live DOM, `x-for` rows and `x-if` clones included, but Alpine's record of them (`_x_lookup`, `_x_currentIfEl`) is a JS property on the template element and does not survive a snapshot. On a restoration visit Alpine re-initialises, sees no record of the rows already in the restored HTML, and renders a SECOND set beside them — the cached set holding no scope, so it renders blank. Symptom: 6 of 6 picks, follow a link, press Back, and "Your Picks" shows twelve rows (six real, six empty). `shared/_alpine_turbo_cache_reset.html.erb` in the app layout strips generated nodes on `turbo:before-cache`; it is layout-wide because the same navigation also doubled the seeds bar's `x-for i in 5` to ten. The sweep calls `Alpine.destroyTree(node)` before detaching each node — guarded on Alpine being defined, since the script runs at body parse and Alpine is deferred. Detaching alone appears to work because Alpine's MutationObserver cleans up afterwards, but that is an internal, not a contract, and this runs on every page. Consequence to design around: a restored page renders `x-for` / `x-if` content from whatever state its `x-data` reads AT INIT — so client state survives Back only if something puts it in the snapshot (see item 8). Cover: `e2e/pick_slots_turbo_restore.spec.js`, `test/views/alpine_turbo_cache_reset_test.rb` and `test/integration/alpine_turbo_cache_reset_wired_test.rb` (the latter proves the layout still RENDERS the partial — the view test alone stays green if that render line is dropped). A browser tier is mandatory here and `page.goto()` will not do: it is a full browser load, never touches the snapshot cache, and passes against the broken build. Use a real in-page link plus `page.goBack()`.
8. **A server-rendered config blob that a component re-reads on init will REVERT client state on Back.** The generalisable half of item 7, and it bit the contest cart. `#board-config` is rendered server-side and `selectionBoard()` re-reads it on every init, so a Turbo restoration visit replayed the cart as of the last SERVER RENDER and dropped every pick made since — the sidebar came back empty. The diagnostic tell is sharp: only state changed since the last server render is lost, so inserting a `page.reload()` before navigating makes it survive (which is exactly why an early version of `pick_slots_turbo_restore.spec.js` carried one). Fixed by `persistCartToConfig()`, bound to `@turbo:before-cache.window` on the board root, which writes the live cart into the blob so the snapshot carries it. Do NOT reach for `turbo-cache-control: no-cache` instead: guests never reach the server at all (`toggleSelection()` returns early on `!loggedIn`), so a refetched page has no cart to restore and loses their picks outright — and Back stops being instant on a heavy page. Cover: `e2e/cart_survives_turbo_restore.spec.js` (signed-in, pick identity, and guest) plus `test/integration/cart_persists_to_board_config_test.rb`, which pins the binding and the method together because they sit ~1200 lines apart in one partial.
9. **`Alpine.evaluate` is synchronous** — returns `undefined` for async expressions. `evaluateLater`'s `extras` shape is version-dependent. For custom async logic, compile your own `AsyncFunction`: `new Function('return (async () => { ... })')().then(...)`.
10. **A boolean attribute bound to a DOTTED expression is SET when the value is `undefined`, and REMOVED when it is `null`.** The two are not interchangeable, and nothing in the ERB shows the difference. `x-bind` rewrites an `undefined` result to `""` whenever the expression contains a dot (`c === void 0 && typeof n === "string" && n.match(/\./) && (c = "")` — alpine.js 3.16.1, vendored in studio-engine). `""` then misses `bindAttribute`'s `[null, undefined, false]` removal test, and for a boolean attribute Alpine assigns the attribute NAME as its value — so `:disabled="props.submitting"` renders `disabled="disabled"` for a prop nobody set. The control paints dead with no console error. It bit `/admin/modals`: the auth **Credentials** card omitted `submitting` from its `MODAL_VARIANTS` props while both live callers (`components/_user_nav.html.erb`, `layouts/_navbar.html.erb`) pass `submitting: null`, so all three credential CTAs plus the email field were untappable in the gallery while production was fine. **CORRECTED (turf-adopts-wallet-credential-slot).** This entry used to conclude “production was always correct, only the preview's props were short,” and therefore that the defence was call-site discipline *instead of* hardening the binding. That conclusion was measured false, and the correction matters because it inverted the priority. Two live paths reach an undefined `props.submitting`, and only one of them is a call site: (1) `app/javascript/solana_utils.js` reopens this modal at the credentials step after a 401 and passed `{ step: 'credentials' }` and nothing else, so every credential control rendered disabled for a user whose session had just expired — the one moment the modal exists to serve; and (2) the `props` getter in `modals/_auth.html.erb` returns an **empty object** whenever `current()` is transiently null during an open or close transition, and **no opener exists on that path at all**. The gallery's short props were a third instance of the same defect, not the only one. So both defences apply, and neither substitutes for the other: **openers pass every key the live call sites pass** (that is what keeps the gallery reviewing the app that ships, and it is the only thing that surfaces prop drift), **and the binding is hardened** with `!!` (that is the only thing that reaches the empty-object transient). The four credential controls now bind `!!props.submitting`; the gem's own copy of the wallet button (`solana_studio/auth/_wallet_credential`) coerces the same way, so hardening converges the two rather than forking them. Cover: `test/controllers/auth_credentials_gallery_test.rb`, which derives the required key set by reading the real call sites rather than hard-coding it, and `test/views/auth_submitting_coercion_test.rb`, which pins the coercion and the seeded 401 reopen.

### Inline JS that stays inline
Some Alpine factories intentionally stay inline in `.erb` partials because Alpine evaluates `x-data` before importmap modules have finished executing. Keep these inline unless the surrounding component is refactored to a registered `Alpine.data(...)` factory loaded before Alpine starts:

- `proofOfReserves()` in `app/views/proof_of_reserves/show.html.erb`
- `contestChat()` and related chat helpers in `app/views/contests/_chat_panel.html.erb`
- callback-bearing hold button expressions that depend on ERB interpolation

Do move pure helper logic into modules when it does not participate in early `x-data` resolution. `StateFanout` is safe as a module because it is invoked from later event callbacks, not during Alpine's first component scan.

## Solana Modal (legacy alias)
`shared/_solana_modal.html.erb` — Now a thin compatibility proxy over `$store.modals` (see § Modal Host above). The store name `Alpine.store('solanaModal')` is preserved for older callsites; new code should call `$store.modals` directly. Three logical states still apply (processing / success / error). `fireSuccessConfetti()` from `solana_utils.js` fires 4 confetti bursts (center, left cannon, right cannon, delayed shower) on the success state via `$watch`.

## Sidebar Primitive and Gear Menu
- **Sidebar primitive** (`components/_sidebar_panel.html.erb`): fixed right panel using `--nav-h`, shared slide transitions, default width `w-80 max-w-full`, optional width override, and optional header actions / close / click-outside / Escape behavior.
- **Shared push class** (`.tm-sidebar-pushed` in `app/assets/tailwind/application.css`): same breakpoint cascade the contest picks sidebar used before extraction — 20rem at `768px`, then 15rem / 10rem / 5rem / overlay at wider breakpoints.
- **The push is invisible to Tailwind's breakpoints, so it needs companion rules.** `md:`/`lg:` are VIEWPORT queries; they cannot see the 320px this class just took away, so a component sized on a breakpoint is sized on a width the pushed column does not have. Two companion rules in the same stylesheet correct that, and both follow the same convention — **plain, unlayered CSS scoped under `.tm-sidebar-pushed`**, never a Tailwind variant. Unlayered author CSS outranks anything inside `@layer utilities` regardless of specificity or source order, so `md:grid-cols-4` and `lg:text-sm` cannot win it back; and the `.tm-sidebar-pushed` scope means the rule applies only while the sidebar is actually open.
  - `768px-1119.98px` — the pushed column wears the phone's grid (`.tm-team-grid` → 2 columns, `.tm-pair-grid` → 1). Below 1120px a four-up card in the pushed column is narrower than the same card on a 390px phone.
  - `1120px-1343.98px` — the pushed column holds the SMALL opponent labels (`.tm-opponent-cell` / `.tm-opponent-week` / `.tm-opponent-row` and its spans). `contests/_multi_week_team_card` steps those up at `lg`, which lands exactly where the pushed card is narrowest; 1344px is where the push steps 20rem → 15rem and the card gets its width back.
  - The two bands abut with no gap by construction. Adding a component that steps up at a breakpoint inside either band means adding a hook and a hold, not widening a band. Both are pinned by `test/views/sidebar_pushed_grid_test.rb` and `test/views/sidebar_pushed_label_hold_test.rb`, which read the small variant out of the partial rather than hard-coding it.
- **Contest picks sidebar** (`contests/_turf_totals_board.html.erb`): renders the desktop "Your Picks" panel through the primitive, keeps cart-specific slots/footer behavior, and still omits a close button so picks stay visible until cleared.
- **Gear sidebar** (`components/_gear_sidebar.html.erb` + `components/_gear_sidebar_trigger.html.erb`): the gear icon, username, and profile image toggle one page-level menu using the same `md` breakpoint boundary as the contest sidebar (`hidden md:flex` desktop panel, full-width `flex md:hidden` mobile drawer). Links: My Profile, My Contests, next quest when present, How to Play, Proof of Reserves, Refresh Wallet, admin shortlist for admins (Dashboard, Contests, Users, Landing Pages), and Log out. The sidebar uses the same emoji-swap animation as the old dropdown and `.tm-gear-sidebar-layer` (`var(--z-drawer)`) so it overlaps both the desktop contest picks sidebar (`z-40`) and the mobile bottom entry slip (`var(--z-docked)`) when the menu is open. The drawer sits BELOW `--z-modal`: a modal opened from the gear menu covers it.
- **Soccer dropdown** (`components/_soccer_dropdown.html.erb`): Soccer ball emoji trigger, links to Teams and Games pages.

## Dev Mode
- **Toggle**: DEV MODE button in the environment banner (top of page). It renders whenever the banner renders — development **and** QA, not devnet only (gem `studio/banners/_environment.html.erb:34`). Styling is the engine `studio/banners/_button` outline variant: transparent background, `1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.9)` border, white text, inverting to a white fill with `#be185d` text on hover/focus (gem `_button.html.erb:27-34` for the outline defaults; the `1px solid` border string is assembled at `:39`, and `#be185d` is the `hover_text_color` default at `:12`). The button carries **no** active/inactive styling — dev mode reads off the `.dev-mode` body class and the `dm-*` classes below, never off the button's own appearance (gem `_dev_mode_button.html.erb:1-4`).
- **Store**: Global `Alpine.store('devMode')` persisted to `localStorage`, initialized on `alpine:init`
- **Body class**: `<body>` gets `.dev-mode` class when active — use `.dev-mode .your-class` for CSS-only debug visuals

### Debug Color Classes (`dm-*`)
Reusable CSS classes in `app/assets/tailwind/application.css` that show colored backgrounds only when dev mode is active. Each uses 75% opacity so overlapping components blend visually. Just add the class to any element — no Alpine bindings needed.

| Class | Color | RGB |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `.dm-blue` | Cornflowerblue | `rgba(100, 149, 237, 0.75)` |
| `.dm-green` | Lightgreen | `rgba(144, 238, 144, 0.75)` |
| `.dm-orange` | Sandybrown | `rgba(244, 164, 96, 0.75)` |
| `.dm-salmon` | Lightsalmon | `rgba(250, 128, 114, 0.75)` |
| `.dm-purple` | Purple | `rgba(128, 0, 128, 0.75)` |
| `.dm-coral` | Lightcoral | `rgba(240, 128, 128, 0.75)` |
| `.dm-yellow` | Khaki | `rgba(240, 230, 140, 0.75)` |
| `.dm-teal` | Paleturquoise | `rgba(175, 238, 238, 0.75)` |

**Current assignments** (navbar only):
- `_navbar.html.erb`: "Turf"=`dm-salmon`, "Totals"=`dm-yellow`, desktop nav=`dm-teal`, user-nav-col=`dm-purple`, mobile sub-nav=`dm-coral`, balance=`dm-blue`
- `_user_nav.html.erb`: gear+morph=`dm-teal`, username=`dm-coral`, seeds bar container=`dm-orange`, avatar link=`dm-green`
- `_navbar_seeds_bar.html.erb`: seeds bar wrapper=`dm-orange`

- **Current uses**:
  - Debug color classes (`dm-*`): layout boundary visualization on navbar/user nav components (see table above)
  - Hidden UI reveals: leaderboard entry debug details, seeds bar "Replay" link, XP slate "Replay" link (all via `x-show="$store.devMode"`)
  - CSS hook: `.dev-mode .nudge-debug { display: block; }` in `app/assets/tailwind/application.css`
- **Adding new debug tools**: Use `x-show="$store.devMode" x-cloak` for Alpine-toggled elements. For layout debugging, add a `dm-*` class to the element — no other changes needed.

## Seeds XP Bar (`_slate_progress_xp.html.erb`)
- Progress bar showing seeds toward next level with animated fill, shimmer, and glow
- Bar fill uses 6px border-radius (not fully rounded)
- Level badge pops on level-up (3.2x scale bounce) with firework burst animation
- Firework: 72 particles explode radially from badge center using branding colors (green, violet, mint, orange, red)
- Level-up data stored in `localStorage('seedsLevelUp')` as JSON, consumed on next page load
- Sequence: fill bar to 100% → level pop + firework → reset bar → fill to new progress
- Dev mode "Replay" link simulates level-up for testing
- Contest show page saves seeds data to `seedsNavbar` localStorage for navbar bar
- Entry confirmation dispatches `navbar-seeds-update` custom event with seeds detail

## Login Page SSO
When SSO session available, blur overlay covers the entire card (`absolute inset-0 z-10, rounded-2xl`). The SSO "Continue as" button sits above the blur (`relative z-20`). Click-to-reveal fades out the blur (500ms transition) and focuses the email field. Uses `.backdrop-overlay` CSS class (defined in `app/assets/tailwind/application.css`).

## Contest Show Layout
- Seeds progress bar and invite card rendered side-by-side on desktop (`flex gap-4 flex-wrap items-stretch` with `flex-1 basis-[300px]`), stacked on mobile.
- "+ Add Another Entry" button appears in the admin actions row (next to Lock Contest, Jump, Rank Matchups) rather than as a standalone section.

## Admin Preview Tools

### Navbar Review (`/admin/navbar`)
Admin page for visually comparing the navbar at all key breakpoints without resizing the browser. Route: `get "admin/navbar"` → `admin#navbar`. Linked from the admin dashboard / link hub.

**Architecture**: Renders the `layouts/navbar` partial (with `preview: true`) inside `.navbar-preview` wrapper divs. Container-scoped CSS classes simulate responsive breakpoints at any viewport width — this is necessary because Tailwind/CSS media queries respond to the viewport, not the container.

**Breakpoint simulation classes** (on the `.navbar-preview` wrapper):
| Class | Range | Overrides |
|---|---|---|
| `.is-mobile .bp-tiny` | 320–399px | Hide `md:flex`, show `md:hidden`, stack title, 1.1rem font |
| `.is-mobile .bp-small` | 400–767px | Same visibility, stack title, 1.25rem font |
| `.is-desktop` | 768–1200px | Default responsive behavior |

**Interactive controls per breakpoint**:
- Width slider with range min/max matching the breakpoint range
- Device marker (vertical line at the device width: iPhone 15 390px, iPhone 16 Pro Max 430px, iPad Pro 13" 1032px)
- Reset button to snap to device width
- **Scrolled toggle**: sets `--nav-p: 0|1` inline on the `.navbar-preview` wrapper (plus `is-scrolled-preview` for the shadow, which a preview header cannot get from `.is-scrolled` — it has no `x-data`, so no `scrolled`). Because `--nav-p` is a registered `<number>`, the wrapper simply **transitions it** (`transition: width 0.15s ease, --nav-p 0.3s ease`) — one interpolating property in place of the five per-element `font-size`/`width`/`padding` transitions and the twelve `!important` rules that used to restate every collapsed value. The preview now exercises the shipped `calc()`s instead of a parallel copy of them.

**Username override**: Text input at the top of the page temporarily overrides the displayed username in all previews (not persisted). Uses `data-username-display` attribute on the username link for targeting. On change, recalculates the overflow fade mask (`overflows` flag) so the gradient fade activates/deactivates at the correct `.username-cap` max-width per breakpoint.

**Sections**: Logged-In View + Pre-Login View, each with all three breakpoints. Deduplicated via loop over `[{ title:, show_logged_in: }]`.

**Key pattern**: When simulating responsive behavior in a preview container, use container-scoped CSS class selectors rather than media queries — a container cannot fire one. Prefer overriding the component's **custom properties** (`.navbar-preview.bp-tiny .nav-shell { --nav-title-size: … }`) over restating its computed values: the override is unlayered so it beats `@layer utilities` without `!important`, and a state toggle becomes a transition on one registered property instead of one per element. Only reach for `!important` where you are fighting a Tailwind responsive *utility* on the element itself (`display`, `width`).

## CSS Refactoring Standards

### Inline style consolidation
- **2+ occurrences** → extract to a named CSS class in a `<style>` block (e.g., `font-size: 10px` × 4 → `.seeds-text`)
- **Component-scoped names**: Use descriptive prefixes tied to the component (e.g., `seeds-bar`, `seeds-fill`, `seeds-text` for the seeds progress bar)
- **One-off layout values** can stay inline (e.g., `max-width: 6rem`, `padding-right: 6px`) — don't create a class for a single use

### Dynamic vs static styles
- **Static properties**: Use CSS classes or Tailwind utilities
- **Alpine-controlled state**: Use `:style` bindings, but split from static properties. Don't mix static padding and conditional devMode background in one `:style` — use `style="..."` for static + `:style="..."` for dynamic
- **Scroll-responsive sizes**: derive them from a scroll-linked custom property, never from `x-bind:class` + `transition-all`. See the navbar's `--nav-p`: a threshold plus a clock lets motion outlive the gesture that asked for it (measured 34px of content travel over 232ms *after* the finger stopped), and it puts a size swap on Alpine's per-scroll reactive path for a 2px change.

### Transitions
- **Never put a LAYOUT property on a clock when a gesture is driving it.** `padding`, `width`/`height` and `font-size` all reflow; on a sticky header they reflow the whole document under the reader. A time-based transition keeps doing that after the finger has stopped. Drive it from scroll position instead (`--nav-p`) and the motion ends exactly when the gesture does.
- **Clocks are still right for paint-only properties** — `box-shadow`, `color`, `opacity`, `transform`. The navbar keeps `transition-shadow duration-300` and `transition-colors duration-300` for exactly that reason.
- **`transition` vs `transition-all`**: Tailwind's `transition` only covers color/opacity/shadow/transform — does NOT include `font-size` or `width`. That exclusion is a feature: if you find yourself reaching for `transition-all` to animate a size, the size probably wants a scroll- or state-linked custom property, not a clock.
- **Preview transitions**: transition the custom property on the preview wrapper (`.navbar-preview { transition: --nav-p 0.3s ease; }`), not each element's `width`/`font-size`. Registered `@property` values interpolate, so one declaration covers every dimension derived from it.

### Admin preview CSS pattern
When building a component preview that needs to simulate responsive behavior:
1. Render the real partial with a `preview` flag that disables dynamic behavior (scroll handlers, sticky positioning)
2. Wrap in a container with breakpoint-simulation classes (e.g., `.is-mobile`, `.bp-tiny`)
3. Override the component's **custom properties** on the container-scoped selectors; fall back to `!important` only for Tailwind responsive utilities applied directly to the element (`display`, `width`)
4. For state toggles (scrolled, hover), set the state's custom property and transition it — never swap between two separate DOM renders (kills transitions), and never restate the component's computed values (they drift)
5. Use higher-specificity selectors for state + breakpoint combinations (e.g., `.navbar-preview.bp-tiny .nav-shell` beats `.nav-shell`)

## Theme variable flow (Tailwind ↔ engine)

Theme colors flow one direction: studio-engine config → CSS custom properties → Tailwind utilities AND hand-rolled CSS.

```
config/initializers/studio.rb   # e.g. theme_primary = "#4BAF50"
        │
        ▼
ThemeSetting (engine)            # 7 role colors persisted per-app
        │
        ▼
<style> in <head>                # --color-primary-rgb: 75 175 80; (RGB triplet)
        │                         # --color-cta, --color-cta-hover, --color-page, …
        ├──> Tailwind config     # primary palette = rgb(var(--color-primary-rgb) / <alpha>)
        │                         #  → utility classes: bg-primary, text-primary, border-primary, ring-primary
        └──> Hand-rolled CSS    # rgb(var(--color-primary-rgb)) directly in .matchup-selected, .pick-pulse, etc.
                                  #  (and in the ENGINE's own layer — .hold-btn themes off the same token from studio-engine)
```

Practical implications:
- New role colors require both an engine palette change AND a safelist entry in `config/tailwind.config.js` (the safelist guards `bg`/`text`/`border`/`ring` utilities so they survive purging).
- Always reference brand colors via the CSS var, never via hex literals — switching themes (or running the `/admin/theme` editor) only updates the var, not hardcoded hex.
- For alpha variants in hand-rolled CSS, use the four-arg form: `rgb(var(--color-primary-rgb) / 0.2)`.

## Layer scale

Every layer that can cover other chrome reads a named `--z-*` tier instead of a bare number. **studio-engine owns the scale outright** — the tiers are defined once, in the gem's `app/assets/tailwind/studio_engine/engine.css` (`-- Layer scale`), and reach this app through the engine build `application.css` imports on line 3. There is no local copy. Read the ORDER, not the number:

`--z-docked` (mobile entry slip) → `--z-nav` (pinned navbar) → `--z-drawer` (gear sidebar) → `--z-modal` (modal backdrop + card, THE app blocker) → `--z-lightbox` → `--z-alert` (live scoring overlay, confetti) → `--z-toast-blur` → `--z-toast` → `--z-banner` (QA / DEV MODE bars, reachable mid-modal) → `--z-tooltip`.

Below 100 the tiers coincide with Tailwind's own `z-10`..`z-50`, so existing sub-100 classes are already on the scale. `test/views/layer_scale_adoption_test.rb` asserts the ordering **against the resolved gem**, refuses any bare blocking number (>= 100) written into `app/views/**/*.erb`, `app/assets/tailwind/**/*.css`, or `app/javascript/**/*.js`, and reads the COMPILED `app/assets/builds/tailwind.css` to prove every tier a browser resolves is the engine's — defined exactly once, at the engine's value.

**Never redefine a tier locally.** This app carried an `ADOPTION SHIM` — a `:root` in `application.css` mirroring the tiers while the pin predated the gem that ships them — and it was deleted in `delete-turf-layer-shim`. It had to go rather than linger: `application.css` imports the engine build FIRST, so a local `:root` further down won on equal specificity and this app silently ran a frozen private copy of the shared scale. Nothing failed; the next engine layer change simply would not have arrived. `test/lib/engine_pin_contract_test.rb` now refuses a re-introduced definition of any engine-shipped tier, in **any** source CSS file this app ships. To change a level, change it in studio-engine.

## Toast layer — the override seam this app no longer uses

`--studio-toast-z` and `--studio-toast-blur-z` are studio-engine's published per-component override seam for the toast stack. **This app sets neither**, and that is the correct state: the engine's own `layouts/studio/_flash.html.erb` defaults them to the shared tiers — `var(--studio-toast-z, var(--z-toast, 400))` and `var(--studio-toast-blur-z, var(--z-toast-blur, 399))` — so toasts already render above both the sticky navbar and any open modal with nothing declared here.

Turf Monster used to set both names on `:root`, from inside the layer-scale adoption shim, back when the engine's own default was a bare `60` (above most content, BELOW a modal — a toast fired from an open modal was invisible). Both the shim and the local overrides went in `delete-turf-layer-shim`. Verified in a real browser after the deletion: `#toast-container` computes `z-index: 400` and `.toast-page-blur` computes `399`, resolved from the engine.

Reach for the seam only for a genuinely turf-specific toast level, and set it once — `test/lib/tailwind_css_dedupe_test.rb` refuses a second declaration, because the later one wins in silence. To move the toast layer for every Studio app, change `--z-toast` in studio-engine instead.

Historical note: the override once lived in an inline style block in `_navbar.html.erb` and needed `!important` to beat the engine's old inline `style="z-index:60"`. The engine stopped rendering that inline style long ago.

## Test scaffolding feature flag (`ENABLE_TEST_SCAFFOLDING`)

When set, the env flag enables two scaffold-only UI elements visible to admins for end-to-end-with-real-money testing without real cost:

- A **`micro` contest tier** in `Contest::FORMATS` — **$1.00 entry, 9 max entries, paying $5 / $2 / $2** ($9.00 guaranteed on $9.00 gross). Surfaces as a card in the Format picker on `/contests/new`, gated by `Contest.selectable_formats` + `AppFlags.test_scaffolding?`. Lets you exercise the full Stripe + entry-token + onchain flow with pocket change.
- A **`test_trio` token pack** (`StripePurchase::PACKS`) — 3 tokens for $5. Surfaces in the auth modal's `tokens-picker` step as a third option alongside `single` ($19) and `trio` ($49). Gated by `StripePurchase.available_packs` + `AppFlags.test_scaffolding?`.

**The `micro` tier is break-even by design** (operator call, 2026-08-27): a full contest grosses exactly the $9 it guarantees, and a short fill loses money — grading pays only the ranks that exist, so 1 entry pays $5 (-$4), 2 pay $7 (-$5), and 3+ pay the full $9, making three entries the worst case at -$6. It exists to rehearse the money path, not to earn on it. `test/models/contest_test.rb` pins the $0 margin so a later "rounding" edit has to be deliberate.

**Production BOOTS with this flag on** (changed 2026-08-27). `config/initializers/test_scaffolding_guard.rb` used to `raise` on a production boot carrying the flag, which made the `micro` tier unreachable on real production — the one place the operator wanted to rehearse. It now logs at ERROR and reports to Sentry instead, so the state is loud but not fatal. That means production really is selling $1.67-per-token entry tokens while the flag is set: **treat it as a test window and unset it when you are done.**

Unset before public launch — the `$1` tier and `$5/3` pack are not customer-facing offers. Memory ref: `project_turf_test_scaffolding`.

## Seeds bar refactor (v0.9.0+)

The 5-section seeds progress bar (`components/_seeds_bar.html.erb`) was refactored from per-segment classes (`.seeds-bar` / `.seeds-fill` / `.seeds-text`) to a single `.seeds-bar-continuous` class plus a CSS-registered `--bar-progress` custom property.

**Why**: per-segment classes meant 5 separate width transitions chained together — each segment's animation curve restarted at the segment boundary, producing a visible staircase. The continuous form interpolates all 5 segment widths from a single transition driven by one variable; per-section shimmer overlays positioned in bar coordinates (`left: -(i-1)*100%, width: 500%`) keep the wave continuous across segments. The result: one ease curve over the whole bar, not 5 chained ones. CSS-only — no JS animation loop.
