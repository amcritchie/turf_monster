# Solana Integration

"DeFi mullet" — Web2 UX front, Solana settlement back. **Read paths** rescue-and-log (balance/seeds display falls back to 0 on RPC error). **Money-mutating paths** (create_contest, enter, settle) are TX-first — the on-chain transaction confirms *before* the DB row is written/promoted — and fail closed: `Solana::Vault.ensure_program_id_live!` raises if `PROGRAM_ID` isn't on the RPC, and `Solana::Config.verify_idl!` refuses to boot/precompile in prod on IDL drift. The app does not transact against a missing or IDL-mismatched program.

## Architecture: self-custody (v0.16+)

There is **no pooled server vault balance**. USDC and USDT live in each user's **own ATA**:
- **Managed (web2) wallets** — Rails holds the user's Ed25519 secret, encrypted at rest, and server-signs on their behalf. Funds still sit in the user's ATA.
- **Phantom (web3) wallets** — true self-custody; the user signs in the browser.

Money movement is decoupled into two PDA families (both owned/authority = the `VaultState` PDA, neither is a pooled "vault balance"):
- **Entry fees** → per-currency **operator-revenue** ATA `[b"op_rev", mint]`. `enter_contest` SPL-transfers the fee from the user ATA into here.
- **Prize pools** → per-contest **prize-pool** ATA `[b"prize_pool", contest_id]`, pre-funded by the contest creator at `create_contest`. Settlement pays winners out of this.

The two are **decoupled**: entry fees are operator revenue and do **not** count toward the settlement cap. The only settlement constraint is `sum(payouts) <= contest.prize_pool`.

## Services (`app/services/solana/`)

Local (turf-monster) classes:
- `Solana::Config` — program ID, RPC URLs (server **and** browser — see below), mints, network, signer set, IDL pinning (`verify_idl!`), plus `redact_rpc_url` (the shared log/terminal redactor for endpoints that carry a provider key).
  - **`Solana::Config.client` is the only sanctioned way to build a server-side RPC client.** A bare `Solana::Client.new` lets the *gem* pick the endpoint — it falls back to `ENV.fetch("SOLANA_RPC_URL", <public devnet>)`, which **fails open** where `Solana::Config::RPC_URL` fails closed (OPSEC-012), and it sits outside the public/credentialed split and `redact_rpc_url`. A caller that genuinely needs its own endpoint passes `rpc_url:` sourced from `Solana::Config`. Enforced against the source tree by `test/services/solana/client_routed_through_config_test.rb` (the sibling of PR 390's `.erb` / `app/javascript` ban, which is blind to Ruby).
- `Solana::Keypair` — Ed25519 keygen, sign, base58, and encrypt/decrypt of managed-wallet secrets via a 256-bit key derived from the **`MANAGED_WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY`** env var (OPSEC-015; `secret_key_base[0,32]` is a legacy fallback only). `#inspect`/`#to_s` are redacted (OPSEC-021).
  - **`Keypair.admin` and credentials in TEST.** `SOLANA_ADMIN_KEY` and `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` are GitHub **repository** secrets. Dependabot PRs run against the separate **Dependabot** secret store and cannot read repository secrets *by design*, so every dependency PR on this repo failed the Solana unit tests permanently — no rebase or re-run could clear it. The real defect was that unit tests which only *assemble* and *encrypt* demanded a production credential. Under **`Rails.env.test?` only**, `Keypair.admin` now falls back to a fixed non-secret keypair (`TEST_ADMIN_SEED`) and the legacy encryptor falls back to `TEST_SECRET_KEY_BASE`. **Outside test both remain a hard raise** — `Keypair.admin` is the Alex Bot signer (1-of-3 on the vault multisig; fee payer for `create_contest` / `enter_contest` / `mint_entry_token`), and a signing path that silently substituted a throwaway key would be far worse than a red CI. `Rails.env` is the discriminator on purpose: a marker like `ENV["CI"]` can be set anywhere, including on a production dyno. Pinned by `test/services/solana/keypair_admin_fallback_test.rb`, which asserts the raise still fires in `production`, `development`, and `staging`.
- `Solana::Vault` — high-level builders + senders for the current TurfVault instruction surface (see table below). Managed-wallet paths sign server-side; Phantom paths build partial transactions for browser/user signatures plus server cosign where required. `sync_balance` surfaces the user's USDC ATA balance (back-compat `:balance` key) + decodes `seeds` from the `UserAccount` PDA; `fetch_wallet_balances` reads USDC/USDT ATAs; `ensure_program_id_live!` guards stale env.
- `Solana::TxVerifier` — fetches a confirmed TX and asserts it touches `PROGRAM_ID` with the expected Anchor discriminator + signer + writable PDA (OPSEC-010). Defeats "submit any successful signature."
- `Solana::ErrorInterpreter` — maps on-chain error codes into the JS eligibility-blocker `{reason, mode, data}` shape. Friendly mappings include the v0.15.1 username codes `6020`/`6021`/`6022` (UsernameReserved / UsernameInvalidChars / UsernameTooShort) and `6027` EntryFeeNotSet (entering with a currency the contest's `entry_fee_by_currency` never funded); `app/javascript/solana_errors.js` (`parseSolanaError`) mirrors the same codes client-side.
- `Solana::Reconciler` — compares **on-chain contest state** (entry counts, slot-0 `entry_fees`) and per-user on-chain account presence against the DB; writes discrepancies to `ErrorLog` only. **No** Slack/Discord webhook. The scheduled cron was **removed 2026-05-19 (OPSEC-040)** — run ad-hoc via the rake tasks below.
- `Solana::ClientLogger` — prepended onto the RPC client to write `OutboundRequest` audit rows.

RPC + serialization primitives come from the **`solana-studio` gem** (`~> 0.5.3`, per `Gemfile`), not local: `Solana::Client` (JSON-RPC over Net::HTTP, retry/blockhash logic), `Solana::Borsh`, `Solana::Transaction` (builder, `find_pda`, `anchor_discriminator`, partial signing), `Solana::SplToken`.

## Anchor Program (`turf-vault/`)

Separate project at `/Users/alex/projects/turf-vault/`. Current deployment identity is canonical in `turf-vault/docs/CURRENT_DEPLOYMENT.md`; do not copy stale program IDs or signer keys from old launch notes.

- Devnet program ID: `EQGFJAcABtDb6VXtiijTjZ6cE2UqdvhnqJvoharJbpMJ`
- Mainnet program ID: `DaFv83yokwTz8msP9CzJ13eazSGk15NuUTxjkfzJzxMM`
- Superseded/orphaned devnet programs include `Dx8uGU5w7B9NytDSsW4kseGZuqdVVRq1KY1mGXN2GaCT` and `7Hy8GmJWPMdt6bx3VG4BLFnpNX9TBwkPt87W6bkHgr2J`; never use them for live verification.
- `VaultState` PDA `[b"vault"]` is a **zero-copy singleton** (~1515 bytes) holding the signer set, threshold, `paused` flag, the pinned `payout_mint` (USDC), the pinned `treasury_authority` (Squads vault PDA), and the 16-slot `accepted_currencies` registry. It holds **no pooled token balance**. Rails decodes it via hardcoded byte offsets in `vault.rb#read_vault_state`.
- IDL: committed at `config/turf_vault.idl.json` for devnet and `config/turf_vault.mainnet.idl.json` for mainnet, SHA256-pinned via `EXPECTED_IDL_HASH` (`Solana::Config.verify_idl!`). Current source-tree hashes: devnet `f11446facec1043cb15b169929aaff3da9e955e05f3c462e86c7b584706246e9`; mainnet `b9b522635894a42f5434f1faa1cd126d146f3042ae2c233acd1dd76a300f7152`. Live Heroku truth is the configured `EXPECTED_IDL_HASH` allow-list; a committed IDL can be staged before a mainnet upgrade is accepted.
- USDC Mint (devnet test): `222Dcu2RgAXE3T8A4mGSG3kQyXaNjqePx7vva1RdWBN9` — registry **slot 0** (= `payout_mint`, the immutable settlement currency).
- USDT Mint (devnet test): `9mxkN8KaVA8FFgDE2LEsn2UbYLPG8Xg9bf4V9MYYi8Ne` — registry **slot 1**. (Mainnet builds pin Circle USDC `EPjFWdd5…Dt1v` + Tether USDT `Es9vMFr…wNYB`.) All amounts are `u64` at 6 decimals (1 USDC = 1_000_000).

### Instructions (22)

| Instruction | Auth | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `initialize` | `INIT_AUTHORITY` (mainnet); any signer on dev | One-time singleton setup: create `VaultState`, pin `payout_mint`=USDC + `treasury_authority`, register USDC (slot 0) + USDT (slot 1), init their `op_rev` ATAs, lock in `signers[3]` + `threshold`. |
| `update_signers` | **2-of-3** | Rotate vault signer pubkeys in place; threshold remains pinned at 2; signer-continuity guard prevents bricking governance. |
| `register_currency` | **2-of-3** | Add a mint to the next free `accepted_currencies` slot + init its `op_rev` ATA. Rejects duplicates / full registry. |
| `deactivate_currency` | **2-of-3** | Flip a slot `active=0` (slot/`op_rev` never reclaimed → `currency_idx` stable). |
| `pause` | **2-of-3** | Set `paused=1` → blocks **only** `enter_contest{,_with_token}` (everything else stays callable). |
| `unpause` | **2-of-3** | Set `paused=0`. No auto-unpause. |
| `create_user_account` | permissionless payer | Allocate `UserAccount` `[b"user", wallet]` with an on-chain-validated `username` (the wallet is *not* a signer → operator-funded onboarding). |
| `set_username` | **user-signed** | Overwrite the caller's username (re-runs `validate_username`; uniqueness/homoglyph checks stay off-chain). |
| `admin_create_user_account` | permissionless payer + **1-of-3** | Create a user account with a reserved-prefix waiver for operator-owned names; charset and minimum length still enforced. |
| `admin_set_username` | **user-signed** + **1-of-3** | Set a reserved-prefix username with owner consent plus vault-signer authorization; charset and minimum length still enforced. |
| `create_season` | **1-of-3** | Create `Season` `[b"season", id]` with an immutable per-entry `seed_schedule [u64;5]`. |
| `create_contest` | **1-of-3** payer + **creator** | Init `Contest` + `prize_pool` ATA and SPL-transfer the creator's USDC into the pool. `sum(payout_amounts) == prize_pool`. Operator-funded contests use the admin for both slots. |
| `set_contest_lock_time` | **1-of-3** | Set/clear `lock_timestamp` (v0.17 derived lock; `0`=no lock). Rejected once settled/cancelled or past `conclusion_timestamp`. |
| `set_contest_conclusion_time` | **1-of-3** | Set/clear `conclusion_timestamp` (v0.18); once chain time passes it, the lock time is final. |
| `enter_contest` | **user-signed** + **1-of-3** payer | Paid entry: SPL-transfer fee user-ATA → `op_rev` ATA, init `ContestEntry`, award seeds, bump `entry_fees`/`current_entries`. One path serves Phantom (user signs) + managed (server signs both slots). |
| `enter_contest_with_token` | **user-signed** + **1-of-3** payer | Token-funded entry: consume an `EntryTokenAccount` (no SPL transfer), award seeds. `currency_idx = 255` sentinel; does **not** bump `entry_fees` (intentional v1 gap). |
| `mint_entry_token` | **1-of-3** | Mint a pre-purchased free-entry voucher `[b"entry_token", sha256(source_ref)]` (`source`: operator/Stripe/MoonPay). Not pause-gated. |
| `grant_seeds` | **1-of-3** | Credit quest/referral seeds to a user's `UserAccount`; idempotent per `(wallet, kind, invitee)` guard PDA. |
| `settle_contest` | **2-of-3** | Grade: per-winner SPL-transfer `prize_pool` → winner ATA (PDA-signed), update entry/user stats. `remaining_accounts` = triples `[user_account, entry, winner_ata]`. Cap = `sum(payouts) <= prize_pool`. |
| `cancel_contest` | **2-of-3** | Refund the full live `prize_pool` balance → creator ATA; status→Cancelled (entry fees stay operator revenue). |
| `close_contest` | **1-of-3** | Reclaim rent on a Settled/Cancelled contest: dust-sweep `prize_pool`→`op_rev` USDC, close both PDAs. |
| `sweep_operator_revenue` | **2-of-3** | Drain an `op_rev` ATA → treasury ATA (enforces `treasury_ata.owner == treasury_authority`). |

### Accounts / PDAs

| Account | Seeds | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `VaultState` | `[b"vault"]` (singleton) | Zero-copy: `signers[3]`, `threshold`, `paused`, `payout_mint`, `treasury_authority`, `accepted_currencies[16]`. No funds. |
| `AcceptedCurrency` | inline (1 of 16 slots in `VaultState`) | `{mint, op_rev_ata, kind, active}`. Slot 0=USDC, 1=USDT. |
| `UserAccount` | `[b"user", wallet]` | 133 B. `username` (on-chain master), `seeds`, stat counters (`entries`/`wins`/`cashes`/`total_won`). **No balance fields** (v0.16). |
| `Contest` | `[b"contest", contest_id]` (`contest_id = SHA256(Rails slug)`) | `prize_pool`, `entry_fee_by_currency[16]`, `entry_fees[16]` (revenue tally), `max_entries`/`current_entries`, `status`, `payout_amounts`, `lock_timestamp` (v0.17), `conclusion_timestamp` (v0.18). INIT_SPACE unchanged v0.16→v0.18 (timestamps carved from `_reserved`). |
| `ContestEntry` | `[b"entry", contest_id, wallet, entry_num u32 LE]` | `status` (Active→Won/Lost), `rank`, `payout`, `currency_idx` (`255` = token-funded). Up to 3 per user (Rails cap). |
| `EntryTokenAccount` | `[b"entry_token", sha256(source_ref)]` | Pre-purchased free-entry voucher. `source` (0=operator/1=Stripe/2=MoonPay), `source_ref_hash`, `consumed`. Discover via `getProgramAccounts` by owner. |
| `Season` | `[b"season", season_id u32 LE]` | Immutable `seed_schedule [u64;5]` (entry N → `seed_schedule[min(N,4)]`). |
| `prize_pool` ATA | `[b"prize_pool", contest_id]` (authority = `VaultState`) | Per-contest USDC prize pool; funded at create, paid at settle, refunded at cancel. |
| `op_rev` ATA | `[b"op_rev", mint]` (authority = `VaultState`) | Per-currency operator revenue; entry fees land here, swept to treasury. |

### Two-level multisig auth

- **1-of-3 vault signer** (`vault_state.is_signer(key)`) — routine ops: `create_contest` (payer), `set_contest_lock_time`, `set_contest_conclusion_time`, `close_contest`, `mint_entry_token`, `create_season`, `grant_seeds`, admin username reserved-prefix waivers, and the **payer** slot of `enter_contest{,_with_token}`. Driven by the always-online Alex Bot server key.
- **2-of-3 multisig** (`vault_state.validate_multisig(admin, cosigner)`, distinct signers) — treasury/governance ops: `settle_contest`, `cancel_contest`, `register_currency`, `deactivate_currency`, `sweep_operator_revenue`, `pause`, `unpause`, `update_signers`.
- **User signature** required for `set_username` and the **user** slot of `enter_contest{,_with_token}` (the user must consent to spending from / consuming their own funds — OPSEC-004).
- `create_user_account` is permissionless (payer only); `initialize` is gated to `INIT_AUTHORITY` on mainnet builds.

Signers (`VaultState.signers`, threshold 2) — the same set on **devnet and mainnet**, re-verified on-chain 2026-09-05 in both `VaultState` PDAs:
- Alex Bot (server) — `8K81w4e6UcB7TiANhM9N8sAgijJvTxxybRi8AENRaRYd`
- Alex (human Phantom, = `INIT_AUTHORITY`) — `7ZDJp7FUHhuceAqcW9CHe81hCiaMTjgWAXfprBM59Tcr`
- Mason — `CytJS23p1zCM2wvUUngiDePtbMB484ebD7bK4nDqWjrR`

### Program Upgrades — Squads multisig (OPSEC-002, 2026-05-19+)

**`anchor deploy` no longer works.** The program upgrade authority is a Squads V4 2-of-3 multisig vault — distinct from `VaultState`'s in-program multisig — not a single keypair. **Each cluster has its own vault PDA**: devnet `BW13kgfiG2koFn3WRkte21NW9TFygsD1ge2fNJdjH6kC`, mainnet `Bk9sS7iiSRL18vuo2KVzkeGw7EekKqxMCjrdoyGGdJm`. Every upgrade goes through the Squad. Running `anchor deploy` will fail because the Solana CLI signs as a single keypair that is no longer the upgrade authority.

**In Rails, read the vault PDA from `Solana::Config.squads_vault_pda` — never as a literal.** It resolves `SOLANA_SQUADS_VAULT_PDA` first (via `.presence`, so an EMPTY value falls through rather than resolving to blank), then falls back to a NETWORK-keyed default (mainnet-beta -> `Bk9s…GdJm`, anything else -> `BW13…H6kC`), so a mainnet build cannot present a devnet authority by omission.

**Neither deployed app sets that variable — the key is ABSENT, not empty.** So the NETWORK-keyed default is the production path on both clusters, and the env var is a runbook escape hatch for pointing an app at a fresh Squad. `SOLANA_NETWORK` is therefore what actually selects the authority: `mainnet-beta` on `turf-monster-mainnet`, `devnet` on `turf-monster-qa` (both present and non-empty).

**Check it by KEY PRESENCE — never with `heroku config:get`.** `config:get` prints a bare newline for an absent key *and* for a present-but-empty one, so it cannot tell the two states apart. This doc used to cite it as the verification method, and that is how "absent" got written down as "length 0" in a review. Ask whether the key exists instead:

```bash
# absent -> false; present -> true (even when its value is the empty string)
heroku config --json --app turf-monster-mainnet | jq 'has("SOLANA_SQUADS_VAULT_PDA")'
heroku config --json --app turf-monster-qa      | jq 'has("SOLANA_SQUADS_VAULT_PDA")'

# independent second read: the table view lists every key BY NAME regardless of
# value, so zero matching lines means the key does not exist.
heroku config --app turf-monster-mainnet | grep -c SOLANA_SQUADS_VAULT_PDA
```

Re-verified 2026-09-05: absent on both apps, with `SOLANA_NETWORK` present and non-empty on both (`mainnet-beta` len 12, `devnet` len 6).

Three readers have carried this literal and been corrected. The view (`app/views/contract/_section_admin_state.html.erb`) showed the devnet Squad on `turf-monster-mainnet` — admin-shows-devnet-authority. Then `Admin::VaultInitController` and `solana:init_vault`, whose devnet fallback was not network-keyed; because the variable is absent, that fallback is what ran, so all three readers had the SAME live symptom — the devnet Squad on the mainnet app. The controller carried a second, LATENT defect in the same expression: `ENV.fetch` does not fall back for an empty value, so a single `heroku config:set SOLANA_SQUADS_VAULT_PDA=` would have turned the wrong address into a blank one. Both readers now route through `Solana::Config.squads_vault_pda` — vault-pda-readers-diverge. The guard in `test/integration/contract_upgrade_authority_test.rb` now bans both cluster literals from **every** `app/` and `lib/` source, not just views; `app/services/solana/config.rb` is the single exempted home for them.

Use `turf-vault/scripts/squad-upgrade.js` — it builds a buffer, sets the buffer authority to the Squad vault, then proposes + approves the upgrade tx through the Squad. Treat `turf-vault/docs/CURRENT_DEPLOYMENT.md` as the canonical program identity record; use the McRitchie Studio credential inventory for current 1Password item names instead of copying key refs into this app doc.

**Post-deploy IDL re-pin (mandatory)**: After every Squad upgrade, turf-monster MUST re-pin `EXPECTED_IDL_HASH` from the **freshly built** IDL — NOT `anchor idl fetch`. Squad upgrades run only the BPF `upgrade` instruction; they do NOT update the on-chain IDL account. `anchor idl fetch` therefore returns the stale pre-upgrade IDL.

```bash
# After deploying turf-vault:
cp /Users/alex/projects/turf-vault/target/idl/turf_vault.json \
   /Users/alex/projects/turf-monster/config/turf_vault.idl.json
cd /Users/alex/projects/turf-monster
shasum -a 256 config/turf_vault.idl.json   # → this is the new EXPECTED_IDL_HASH

# Set EXPECTED_IDL_HASH on Heroku BEFORE git push (assets:precompile runs verify_idl!):
heroku config:set EXPECTED_IDL_HASH=<sha> -a turf-monster-mainnet

# Then commit + deploy
git add config/turf_vault.idl.json
git commit -m "Re-pin IDL after turf-vault vX.Y.Z deploy"
bin/deploy
```

`Solana::Config.verify_idl!` will refuse to boot — and to precompile assets — in production when the file's SHA256 ≠ `EXPECTED_IDL_HASH`. Running prod against a drifted IDL silently corrupts every Borsh decode.

**Also refresh the `/contract` page**: if the deploy changed the instruction set, byte sizes, auth roles, or any Rails call site, update the hand-maintained data in `app/views/contract/show.html.erb` (the public `/contract` transparency page; admin sections include the web2/web3 caller map). Its version pill + network auto-track the re-pinned IDL (`Solana::Config.idl_version` / `NETWORK`), but the per-instruction byte/caller data does not. Re-measure bytes with a debug-info rebuild (`CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_DEBUG=2 … cargo-build-sbf` → `llvm-objdump --syms | rustfilt`, dedup by address, bucket by instruction module).

### Multisig Settlement Flow
1. `Contest#grade!` scores entries and calls `settle_onchain!`
2. `settle_onchain!` calls `Vault#build_settle_contest` → creates a `PendingTransaction` with the partially-signed TX (2-of-3)
3. Admin visits `/admin/pending_transactions` (Treasury page)
4. Clicks "Co-sign" → Phantom signs as the second signer → TX submitted to Solana
5. On-chain: per-winner SPL transfer `prize_pool` PDA → winner USDC ATA (PDA-signed by `VaultState` seeds); contest status → Settled

> ⚠️ `grade!` marks the DB `settled` (writes `payout_cents` + TransactionLog credits) even if the on-chain settle PT is never cosigned — the sweeper deliberately skips treasury PTs, so no alert fires on an un-cosigned settle. Cosign promptly or winners stay unpaid on-chain.

## Navbar Balance

`display_balance` helper shows the user's on-chain **USDC + USDT combined** (operator request 2026-06-10 — the pill is total spendable dollars; the `/account` tiles stay per-currency) for **all** wallet types — there is no DB-balance tracking in v0.16. Cache-first + non-blocking: it sums the cached `usdc_cache_key` + `usdt_cache_key` values (60s TTL), returns `nil` when both are cold ("loading" — the pill is hidden until the client hydrate paints it), and never issues an RPC on the render path. The `/admin/usdc_balance` JSON endpoint's `balance` field is the same combined sum (per-currency `usdc`/`usdt`/`seeds` ride alongside); it is the one `AdminController` action excluded from `require_admin` (self-only; audit #27). The blocking reads live in `ApplicationController#fetch_navbar_hydrate` → `Vault#fetch_wallet_balances` + `sync_balance`, fanned out in parallel threads, which also warms the caches.

**Balance refresh system**: **`refreshSession()`** (→ `/account/session_refresh`) is THE single page-load hydrate — the layout's `hydrateNavbar()` calls it on every load, and the gear sidebar calls it on demand. It updates the combined balance slot (`[data-balance-display]` for the amount, `[data-free-entry-label]` for the "✨ Free Entry" stand-in at $0-with-tokens, picked by `applyBalanceSlotRule`), the ✨ badge (`updateNavTokens`), the seeds bar, `$store.session.usdcCents`/`usdtCents`/`tokensAvailable`, and the wallet tiles. The token count follows the wallet that can sign in the active session: managed address for web2, Phantom address for web3. Entry success does not call `refreshSession()`; both board success branches lower the store immediately through `mirrorTokenSpend()` when the server returns `token_consumed`, while server-side cache invalidation makes the next hydrate authoritative. `refreshBalance()` (→ `/admin/usdc_balance`) is the lighter balance+seeds-only sibling; `refreshBalanceDelayed(ms)` waits (default 10s) then calls it — spins the navbar refresh icon during the wait. **Wallet tiles**: both hydrate paths call `updateWalletTiles(data)` — any page subscribes a readout by tagging an element `data-wallet-tile="usdc|usdt|sol|tokens"` (the `/account` Identities row; its Refresh Wallet button is the `walletRefresh` factory in `shared/_alpine_factories.html.erb`). Null fields (flaked RPC) never overwrite a prior render.

## Wallet Types

- **Managed (web2)**: Server generates an Ed25519 keypair and stores the secret encrypted (via `MANAGED_WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY`), signing on behalf of the user. USDC still lives in the user's own ATA.
- **Phantom (web3)**: User connects the Phantom browser extension (or any Wallet-Standard wallet) and signs transactions directly.

Client signing paths run a network-intent guard before wallet requests. The guard compares Rails env to the app's configured Solana cluster (`production` → Mainnet, everything else → Devnet); unknown or mismatched cluster state opens the `network-guard` modal and requires an explicit checkbox acknowledgement before signing. Phantom does not expose its selected wallet network to websites, so this is an app-cluster/environment guard rather than a browser-readable Phantom-network assertion.

## Hard Escrow Contest Creation (Phantom-driven, 2026-05-18+)

Contest creation transfers the prize-pool USDC from the creator's Phantom wallet into the **per-contest `prize_pool` PDA** `[b"prize_pool", contest_id]` (authority = `VaultState`) — real hard escrow, not just a number on a PDA, and **not** a shared vault balance. Dual-signer: the admin bot pays SOL rent, the creator's Phantom signs the USDC transfer.

The on-chain TX completes **before** the DB row is created, so the database always reflects committed on-chain state.

1. Admin fills form + submits → `POST /contests` (`ContestsController#create`)
   - Click-time prechecks: on-chain `Contest` PDA must not exist; creator's USDC must cover the prize pool. Insufficient-USDC modal includes a "Mint $500 Test USDC" recovery button.
   - Server builds a fully unsigned `create_contest` TX with both required signature slots reserved (admin payer + creator). Returns the unsigned TX + a signed `params_token`.
2. Client: `phantom.signTransaction(tx)` only. The browser serializes the Phantom-signed wire with the admin slot still empty and posts it back; it does not simulate, broadcast, or poll.
3. `POST /contests/finalize` (`ContestsController#finalize`) — collection route, no `:id`.
   - `Vault#assert_create_contest_cosign_safe!` semantically validates the signed wire against the server-issued payload (fee schedule, payouts, prize pool, lock timestamp, slug-derived PDA, expected accounts) before the admin key signs anything.
   - Rails admin-cosigns, simulates, broadcasts, waits for confirmation, then verifies via `verify_solana_transaction!` (OPSEC-010 — matches the `create_contest` discriminator + expected accounts).
   - Creates the DB row with `skip_onchain_callback = true` so the legacy `Contest#create_onchain!` after_create callback doesn't double-spend.

### Legacy server-only fallback

`Contest#create_onchain!` (via `after_create`) is preserved for Rails console / scripts / tests (`Rails.env.test?` auto-skips). The old `POST /contests/:id/prepare_onchain_contest` + `confirm_onchain_contest` endpoints still exist for backward compat and are referenced by `e2e/onchain.spec.js` — the production UI no longer uses them.

## Onchain Entry — three payment rails, one confirm gate

All three end at `Entry#confirm!` / `#confirm_onchain!`, which enforce the payment-proof (`tx_signature`), lock-time, exactly-`picks_required`, no-locked-games, per-user-limit, and sybil checks.

1. **Managed-wallet token-consume** — managed user with an `EntryTokenAccount`: `Vault#enter_contest_with_token` signs with the server-held keypair; consumes the token (no USDC moves), awards seeds, then `bust_entry_tokens_cache!`.
2. **Managed-wallet USDC** — `Vault#enter_contest` signs **both** the admin (payer) and user (server-managed keypair) slots and broadcasts directly. SPL transfer user-ATA → `op_rev` ATA. There is no DB-balance or PDA-balance deduction — neither exists in v0.16.
3. **Phantom-direct** — Phantom-FIRST (2026-06-06): `prepare_entry` selects an unconsumed token owned by `web3_solana_address` first and builds `enter_contest_with_token`; otherwise it builds the currency-funded `enter_contest`. Both wires are fully unsigned (admin reserved as fee-payer + nonce-authority but NOT signed) and the server records the funding choice plus token PDA on a `PendingTransaction`. Phantom signs first; the client POSTs the signed wire bytes to `confirm_onchain_entry`, which admits only the recorded instruction/funding pair, admin-cosigns (`Vault#cosign_and_broadcast_entry` via `Solana::Transaction.cosign_wire`), runs a `simulateTransaction` pre-flight, broadcasts **server-side**, then verifies (`TxVerifier`) and runs `Entry#confirm_onchain!`. If Phantom dismisses or invalidates the unsigned request, `discard_prepared_entry` safely expires only that user's signatureless PT and a user-tapped **Try Again** refreshes session state before `prepare_entry` builds fresh wire bytes; no page reload is required. Signed PTs are never discarded because they may have been broadcast. `recover_pending_entry` resolves those signed entries stranded by a mid-flight refresh (also TxVerifier-gated — Lazarus audit #1) and invalidates spent-token caches on both full verification and the already-active shortcut.

**Currency selection (2026-06-10)**: `prepare_entry` takes a strict `currency=usdc|usdt` param (default `usdc`). USDT is rejected unless the contest's `accepts_usdt` flag is set — only contests whose on-chain `entry_fee_by_currency` slot 1 was funded at creation accept it, and that array is **immutable** after `create_contest`, so contests created before 2026-06-11 stay USDC-only forever (the program rejects `currency_idx: 1` with `EntryFeeNotSet` 6027). The endpoint ensures the user's ATA for the SELECTED mint and threads `currency_idx` (0=USDC, 1=USDT) into `build_enter_contest` + the `PendingTransaction` metadata. Client: `#board-config` carries `acceptsUsdt`, the flow auto-picks USDC-first/USDT-fallback, and `eligibilityBlocker(session, neededCents, { acceptsUsdt })` only counts USDT funds on accepts-USDT contests.

(There is one unified `enter_contest` instruction — the old `enter_contest_direct` was removed in v0.16. Phantom users' navbar balance decreases live after the transfer; no DB balance is tracked for any wallet type.)

## Seeds System (On-Chain)

Seeds are awarded on-chain per the active **Season**'s `seed_schedule` (turf-vault v0.11.0+). Default schedule is `[25, 19, 14, 10, 7]` — entry index 0 → 25 seeds, index 4+ clamps to slot 4. No DB column for the seeds count — read from the `UserAccount` PDA via `Solana::Vault#sync_balance`. UI-derived levels: `level = seeds / 100 + 1` (`SEEDS_PER_LEVEL = 100`); class methods `User.level_for(seeds)`, `seeds_toward_next_level(seeds)`, `seeds_progress_percent(seeds)`. The active season is tracked in `SeasonConfig.current_season_id` (Rails singleton); the on-chain `Season` PDA lives at `[b"season", season_id_le]`. Compute an entry's award via `Solana::Vault.new.seeds_for_entry(entry_num)`. Progress-bar partial `_seeds_bar.html.erb` (navbar via `_user_nav` + contest show via `_slate_progress_xp`); level-up confetti; "Free Entry Earned 🎟️" badge in the entry-confirm modal. The level-up token is **minted automatically**: a trusted fresh seed snapshot calls `LevelUpTokenMintJob.nudge`, which updates the denormalized mirror and immediately enqueues a targeted run. The target re-reads live chain truth through `Tokens::LevelUpGrant` before minting, and the client polls the canonical session hydrate with bounded backoff so the token badge appears without a reload. The every-15-minute `LevelUpTokenMintJob` cron in `config/schedule.yml` remains a recovery sweep for missed enqueues and RPC outages. Both paths mint one `EntryTokenAccount` per milestone under the **deterministic** `source_ref` `levelup:<deployment>:<wallet-hash>:<level>` (the deployment is `qa` or the Rails env; the wallet hash is the first 16 hex of `sha256(address)`, kept short because `padded_source_ref` raises past 64 bytes). Because the PDA is `sha256(source_ref)` and the program `init`s it, a repeat mint collides on-chain — so retries and overlapping runs cannot double-grant, and the chain itself is the ledger of which levels are paid. **The wallet and the deployment are both in the ref because neither is in the PDA seeds**: `entry_token_pda` derives from `sha256(source_ref)` under the program id alone, and `SOLANA_PROGRAM_ID` defaults to the SAME devnet program for development, test and QA — so a ref keyed only on `users.id` made QA user 7 and a local dev user 7 collide on one account, where the loser's mint fails forever. The PDAs outlive the database, so a QA reset reproduces it wholesale. The sweep's candidate query is pure SQL against the denormalized mirror, so an idle run issues **zero** Solana RPCs: the partial index `index_users_on_pending_level_up_grants` carries the predicate `level > entry_tokens_granted_level` and is keyed `(entry_tokens_swept_at, id)` — the sweep's own `ORDER BY` — so the batch is read straight off it in rotation order. `entry_tokens_swept_at` is stamped on **every** pass (minted, nothing owed, unevaluable, or raised) purely to send a just-visited row to the back of the queue; it is never a record of payment, which remains `entry_tokens_granted_level` and advances only on proof. Rotation is what stops a permanently stuck row from occupying the batch and starving every user behind it. A user the sweep cannot evaluate — no `UserAccount` PDA at their address, so on-chain seeds cannot be read — is reported with a named log line **and** an `ErrorLog`, never skipped silently. The mint count is clamped to the same `owed` figure `/admin/free_entries` computes (`seeds / 100 - tokens.length`), so it never pays over an operator's manual mint — that page remains the manual backstop, its arithmetic unchanged. `User#level` is persisted by `update_level_from_seeds!` from trusted server-side chain reads.

The per-season schedule above is authoritative for Turf Monster; update this doc and the active `SeasonConfig`/vault setup together when changing rewards.

## Rake Tasks (`lib/tasks/solana.rake`)

- `solana:init_vault` — initialize the vault on devnet. Args `INIT=true SIGNERS=addr1,addr2,addr3 THRESHOLD=2` (optional `TREASURY=<squads_vault_pda>`, otherwise `Solana::Config.squads_vault_pda` — `SOLANA_SQUADS_VAULT_PDA`, then the NETWORK-keyed cluster default; it is never a fixed literal, because `treasury_authority` is PINNED at initialize time and a devnet Squad pinned on mainnet cannot be swept to). OPSEC-013-gated in production. There is no `force_close` arg — the `force_close_vault` instruction was removed in v0.16; teardown = redeploy the program.
- `solana:health` — pre-flight before any cluster flip: genesis-hash match + program-exists-on-RPC + IDL-hash match. Exits non-zero on mismatch. **A check that could not RUN is reported as such, never as a tick** — the program-exists step reads `Solana::Vault.ensure_program_id_live!`'s tri-state return (`:live` / `:cached` / `:unverified`) rather than inferring a pass from the absence of a raise. That guard fails OPEN on purpose (`TokenPurchaseJob` depends on it), so against a rejecting endpoint the task used to print `✓ PROGRAM_ID exists on RPC` one line below `getGenesisHash failed`. It also passes `force: true`, so a ≤5-minute cache entry cannot answer for the CURRENT endpoint, and it builds its `Solana::Client` inside a rescue so a fat-fingered endpoint is diagnosed instead of raising past every check.
- `solana:idl_hash` — print the committed IDL's SHA256 (the value for `EXPECTED_IDL_HASH`).
- `solana:verify_idl` — run `verify_idl!` against the committed IDL.
- `solana:airdrop` — airdrop SOL to admin.
- `solana:check_balance` / `solana:check_admin_balance` — read on-chain SOL/USDC balances.
- `solana:mint_usdc` — mint test USDC to the admin ATA (`AMOUNT=<dollars>`, default 100). **Devnet only — hard-aborts on live production (OPSEC-020).** QA apps are exempt: they boot as Rails production but set `QA_ENV=true`, so `AppFlags.live_production?` reads false there and the devnet tooling stays usable.
- `solana:fund_wallets` — fund a set of wallets (dev bring-up).
- `solana:generate_keypair` / `solana:test_encryption` / `solana:reencrypt_managed_wallets` — managed-wallet key tooling (the last rotates ciphertext to the current `MANAGED_WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY`).
- `solana:reconcile` — run `Solana::Reconciler` over all users (on-chain account-presence / state checks; no pooled balance reconciliation).
- `solana:reconcile_contest CONTEST=<slug>` — compare an on-chain contest's entry count + slot-0 `entry_fees` against the DB.

## Public faucet endpoint

`/faucet` is a public route — GET renders a marketing page; POST mints test USDC to the requester's wallet via `Vault#mint_spl(amount_lamports, mint: Solana::Config::USDC_MINT, to: wallet)`. Used by the "Mint $500 Test USDC" recovery button in the insufficient-USDC modal during Phantom-driven contest creation. `FaucetController#claim` mints via `Vault#mint_spl` directly (not the `solana:mint_usdc` rake task) and guards itself: it raises "Faucet is production-disabled" when `Rails.env.production?` and requires `Config.devnet?`.

## RPC endpoints — server vs browser

There are **two** RPC endpoints, and mixing them up publishes a paid-provider
credential.

| | Constant / method | Env var | Who holds it |
|---|---|---|---|
| Server | `Solana::Config::RPC_URL` | `SOLANA_RPC_URL` | Rails, Sidekiq, rake. May carry an api-key. |
| Browser | `Solana::Config.public_rpc_url` | `SOLANA_PUBLIC_RPC_URL` | Every visitor, logged in or not. Must never carry a credential. |

**The bug this split closes.** Six surfaces used to emit `RPC_URL` verbatim into
the response body — `body[data-solana-rpc-url]` in `layouts/application` and
`layouts/modal_preview`, `#cosign-config[data-rpc-url]` on the three admin
cosign pages, and `@page_config[:rpc_url]` on `/proof-of-reserves`, which is
UNAUTHENTICATED and additionally renders the value as visible page text. On
`turf-monster-mainnet` that constant is a Helius endpoint carrying an `api-key`
query param, so every page load shipped the credential to every browser. The
`solana:health` / `solana:preflight` rakes had redacted the same constant before
printing it to a terminal since launch; the DOM was the one place that did not.

Redacting the CONSTANT is not the whole job. `Solana::Client::InsecureRpcUrlError`
and `URI::InvalidURIError` both embed the entire credentialed endpoint in their own
`.message` (the gem interpolates `@rpc_url.inspect`), so an exception printed or
logged raw republishes the key beside a correctly-redacted constant. Use
`Solana::Config.redact_message(e.message)` for any exception on this path —
`redact_rpc_url` returns `***` for a whole sentence, destroying the diagnostic.
`Solana::ClientLogger` applies the same redaction to `outbound_requests.endpoint`
and `.error_message`: failed RPCs always log, and a key rotation drives a burst of
failures, so that table was re-recording the OLD key at the moment of rotation.
(Rows written before that fix still carry it — purging them is an ops task.)

**Resolution order** (`Solana::Config.public_rpc_url`), each step checked
against `credentialed_rpc_url?`:

1. `SOLANA_PUBLIC_RPC_URL` — an endpoint provisioned *for* the browser.
2. `SOLANA_RPC_URL`, when it carries no credential. This is what keeps dev,
   test and QA byte-identical: their RPC_URL is the public devnet endpoint, so
   the browser receives exactly what it received before the split.
3. The cluster's canonical public endpoint (`PUBLIC_CLUSTER_RPC_URLS`).

Step 1 is **checked, not trusted**: a credential pasted into
`SOLANA_PUBLIC_RPC_URL` is dropped and logged (redacted), not served. The guard
bites at the emission, which is why this is a predicate and not just a renamed
variable.

`credentialed_rpc_url?` is deliberately broad and fails closed — any query
string (Helius `?api-key=`), any userinfo (`https://user:pass@…`), any opaque
path segment ≥20 chars (Alchemy `/v2/<key>`, QuickNode `/<hash>/`), or an
unparseable URL. A false positive costs a slower public endpoint and is fixed by
setting `SOLANA_PUBLIC_RPC_URL`; a false negative publishes a key.

**Operational note.** On mainnet, leaving `SOLANA_PUBLIC_RPC_URL` unset is
*safe* but *slow*: the browser drops to `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`,
which rate-limits aggressively and is on the path for Phantom transaction
submission, `getSignatureStatuses` polling, and the proof-of-reserves balance
reads. Set it to a provider key that is safe to publish — a domain-restricted
key or a public-tier key — and treat it as public from the moment it is set.

**Not checked:** that the browser endpoint names the same *cluster* as
`SOLANA_RPC_URL`. Verifying that needs a genesis-hash round trip, which belongs
to the OPSEC-039 initializer (`config/initializers/solana_network_alignment.rb`)
and not to a render path. The defaults are network-keyed so omission cannot
cross clusters; an explicit `SOLANA_PUBLIC_RPC_URL` can, so set it per app.

Guards: `test/services/solana/public_rpc_url_test.rb` (the primitive) and
`test/integration/rpc_credential_not_in_browser_test.rb` (every browser surface,
plus a standing ban on any `.erb` or `app/javascript` file naming the server
constant at all).

## Boot alignment guard (OPSEC-039) and rotating the server RPC key

`SOLANA_RPC_URL` carries a provider key on mainnet, so it will need rotating.
That used to be unsafe. The alignment guard
(`config/initializers/solana_network_alignment.rb`) rescued exactly one class,
`Solana::Client::RpcError` — but an unauthorized provider answers with a body
that is not JSON at all, and solana-studio's `Solana::Client#call` runs
`JSON.parse(response.body)` with no rescue of its own. The resulting raw
`JSON::ParserError` walked past the rescue and **aborted boot**, including at
slug compile — so revoking the old key took the app down AND blocked the deploy
that would have fixed it. Enumerating the exception classes a hostile upstream
can produce was the mistake; there is no complete list.

The guard now separates two outcomes, and only one of them is fatal:

| Outcome | What it proves | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Genesis hash came back and **disagrees** | the RPC really is a different cluster | **refuses to boot** (unchanged) |
| Unreachable, unauthorized, non-JSON, or no hash | nothing about alignment | logs at ERROR with the endpoint **redacted**, continues boot |

Refusing to boot on the absence of evidence turns a third-party outage into a
self-inflicted one, and this hook runs during slug compile, so it would take the
remediation path down with it. The degraded log line says the guard did not run;
the transaction paths surface the underlying error at the point of use.

**Rotation order.** Set the new `SOLANA_RPC_URL`, deploy, confirm
`bin/rails solana:health` is green, then revoke the old key. Revoking first is
now survivable — the app boots and logs `alignment check INCONCLUSIVE` — but
on-chain reads degrade until the new key is live.

`solana:health` carries the same widening, so on a rejected key it reports
`getGenesisHash failed: JSON::ParserError` and still reaches its verdict instead
of aborting at step 2 with a stack trace.

Guards: `test/initializers/solana_network_alignment_test.rb` (drives the real
initializer against real non-JSON bodies over a real socket, and asserts BOTH
halves — the indeterminate cases boot, a real mismatch still refuses) and
`test/tasks/solana_health_unauthorized_rpc_test.rb`.

## Solana Auth Security

- **SIWS / nonce replay prevention**: Solana sign-in nonces include a timestamp with an enforced 5-minute expiry; the nonce is deleted from the session before verification (delete-before-verify) to prevent replay. Signature verification is host-bound (`Solana::AuthVerifier`, OPSEC-018).
- **TX verification**: `Solana::TxVerifier` binds a submitted signature to the expected instruction + signer + server-re-derived PDA before any DB state is credited (OPSEC-010).

## Error namespace

turf-vault custom errors start at **6000** (`errors.rs`). Anchor framework **3000-range** errors (e.g. 3012 `AccountDidNotDeserialize`) signal **schema drift** between the deployed program and an on-chain account — i.e. an IDL/layout mismatch — **not** a vault error. Key codes: `ContestNotOpen` 6003, `ContestAlreadySettled` 6006, `SettlementOverflow` 6008, `ContestNotCancellable` 6029, `ContestLocked` 6034, `ContestConcluded` 6035. Several codes (6011/6012/6017/6019/6028) are retired-but-kept for numbering stability.
