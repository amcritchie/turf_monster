# Coinbase CDP Onramp + Offramp (USDC on Solana) — turf-monster implementation spec

> Generated 2026-06-09 from a doc-extraction pass over live docs.cdp.coinbase.com pages (81 facts, every claim source-cited below). The Ruby JWT recipe in §3 was verified locally against this repo's exact gem versions. Where two doc pages conflict, the conflict is recorded in **Open questions** and the spec states the default we build to.

> Provider selection rationale (why Coinbase over MoonPay/Transak/Ramp/Stripe) lives in the 2026-06-09 ramp research: MoonPay's and Ramp's terms prohibit our category; Stripe has no consumer off-ramp and prohibits paid-entry prize contests outright. Coinbase + Transak were the only capability-complete options without a verified categorical prohibition.

**Scope.** Hosted-page integration on `turfmonster.media` (Rails 7 / Heroku), with `app.turfmonster.media` kept as a legacy alias while provider dashboards migrate. Buy = onramp USDC into the user's Solana wallet; Sell = offramp USDC to fiat via the Coinbase-hosted widget. Both wallet modes: Phantom (`user.web3_solana_address`, self-custody) and managed (`user.web2_solana_address`, server can sign). Primary integration is the **v1 session-token flow** (`POST /onramp/v1/token`) because it is the only documented path for offramp and serves both directions [^1][^4]; the v2 `POST /v2/onramp/sessions` API is noted as an optional later swap for buy-side only [^17]. Session tokens are mandatory for all hosted URLs since 2025-07-31 [^18].

## 1. Gems

- Already bundled: `jwt (3.1.2)`, `ed25519 (1.4.0)` (`Gemfile.lock`).
- **Add `gem "jwt-eddsa", "~> 0.9"`** and `require "jwt/eddsa"` in the auth service. Vanilla jwt 3.x raises `JWT::EncodeError: Unsupported signing method` for EdDSA — the CDP docs' Ruby snippet predates jwt 3.0's extraction of EdDSA into jwt-eddsa and does NOT work as written against this bundle (verified locally on the exact gem versions) [^2].
- Housekeeping: jwt-eddsa 0.9.0 was `--user-install`ed to `~/.gem/ruby/3.1.0` during verification; the Gemfile entry supersedes it.
- Zero-new-gem fallback: create the CDP Secret key as **ECDSA** and sign `ES256` via `OpenSSL::PKey::EC.new(pem)` — verified working on jwt 3.1.2 with no extra gems — at the cost of the "legacy" key type [^2].

## 2. Env vars + feature flag

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CDP_API_KEY_ID` | Secret API Key UUID — used as both JWT `kid` header and `sub` claim |
| `CDP_API_KEY_SECRET` | base64; MUST decode to exactly 64 bytes (32-byte Ed25519 seed ‖ 32-byte pubkey); validate and raise on mismatch [^3] |
| `CDP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Phase 2 only — `metadata.secret` returned once at webhook subscription creation [^12] |
| `ENABLE_CDP_RAMP` | Feature flag, off by default everywhere |

Feature flag follows the existing `AppFlags.test_scaffolding?` pattern in `app/services/app_flags.rb`:

```ruby
def self.cdp_ramp?
  ENV["ENABLE_CDP_RAMP"].to_s.strip.downcase == "true"
end
```
Gate routes, controllers, and all UI entry points on it (kill-switch = unset the var).

## 3. `Cdp::Auth` — per-request JWT (`app/services/cdp/auth.rb`)

Exact recipe (Ed25519 / EdDSA) [^2][^3]:

```ruby
decoded = Base64.decode64(ENV.fetch("CDP_API_KEY_SECRET"))
raise "Invalid Ed25519 key length" if decoded.length != 64
signing_key = Ed25519::SigningKey.new(decoded[0, 32])
header = { alg: "EdDSA", typ: "JWT", kid: key_id, nonce: SecureRandom.hex(16) }
claims = {
  sub: key_id, iss: "cdp", aud: ["cdp_service"],
  nbf: Time.now.to_i, exp: Time.now.to_i + 120,            # 2-minute max validity
  uri: "#{method.upcase} api.developer.coinbase.com#{path}" # e.g. "POST api.developer.coinbase.com/onramp/v1/token"
}
JWT.encode(claims, signing_key, "EdDSA", header)
```

- `uri` claim = `METHOD<space>host<path>` — no scheme, no space between host and path; it binds the JWT to ONE method+host+path [^2].
- The signed path **EXCLUDES the query string** — every official CDP example builds the claim from the path only and the official SDKs sign `url.pathname` (the Coinbase REST auth docs say explicitly not to include query parameters in the signed path). Sign `path.split("?").first`; the query stays on the actual request URI. The failure mode of signing the query is asymmetric and nasty: `POST /onramp/v1/token` (no query) works and money moves, while every status poll and catalog GET 401s — status tracking dead, offramp `to_address` discovery dead, and the fail-closed catalog masquerades as a geo problem.
- Generate a **fresh JWT per request**; never cache (120 s expiry + per-URI binding).
- Sent as `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` on every CDP REST call [^3].

## 4. `Cdp::Client` (`app/services/cdp/client.rb`)

Thin HTTP wrapper for `https://api.developer.coinbase.com`: `get(path, params)` / `post(path, body)` → fresh `Cdp::Auth` JWT, JSON body, typed error wrapping the Status schema `{code, message, details}` [^1]. Casing is mixed by design — request bodies camelCase (`addresses`, `clientIp`), v1 responses snake_case (`partner_user_ref`, `to_address`), webhook payloads camelCase — translate at call sites, no global key transform. Money pairs are `{value: String, currency: String}` — parse `value` with `BigDecimal`, never Float. Route through the existing `OutboundRequestLogger` for parity with the rest of the outbound stack.

## 5. `Cdp::SessionTokenService` — the shared token mint

`POST https://api.developer.coinbase.com/onramp/v1/token` [^1] — same endpoint for buy AND sell [^4].

```json
{
  "addresses": [{ "address": "<user solana pubkey>", "blockchains": ["solana"] }],
  "assets": ["USDC"],
  "clientIp": "<request.remote_ip>"
}
```

- Onramp: address = **destination** wallet. Offramp: address = **source** of funds being sold [^4]. One address per network.
- Address selection — **both directions ask the SESSION** (`SessionContext#web3?`), never account identity: `web3_solana_address` when this session authenticated with Phantom, else the managed `web2_solana_address`. Onramp credits the wallet the session can spend from; offramp sources the wallet it can sign with. One exception, onramp only: an account with no managed wallet gets `web3_solana_address` as the destination rather than a refusal. `User#solana_address` is deliberately NOT used — it is web3-preferred, so it credited Phantom for a combo account whose entry pays from the managed wallet.
- Exact values for USDC-on-Solana: asset ticker `"USDC"`, network slug `"solana"` (lowercase); "To enable USDC on the Solana network, you must pass in a Solana formatted destination address" [^19].
- `clientIp`: treat as **required** (the canonical `/onramp/reference` page marks it required; see open questions for the page conflict). Heroku tension: docs say "Do not trust X-Forwarded-For", but Heroku's router delivers the client IP only via XFF and appends the true client last — `request.remote_ip` is the only realistic source; document the assumption [^1].
- Response: `{"token": "...", "channel_id": ""}`. Token is **single-use and expires after 5 minutes** — mint at click time (AJAX), never at page render, never cache [^1][^5].
- Do NOT use the deprecated `destinationWallets` param [^1].

## 6. Onramp URL builder (`Cdp::OnrampUrl`)

Base: `https://pay.coinbase.com/buy/select-asset` [^4][^6]. Params (documented set only):

| Param | Value |
|---|---|
| `sessionToken` | required, from §5 |
| `partnerUserRef` | `tm-#{user.id}-#{ramp.id}` (per-session; must be < 50 chars; note it is `partnerUserRef`, NOT `partnerUserId`) [^6] |
| `redirectUrl` | `https://turfmonster.media/cdp/onramp/return` — production values must be on the domain allowlist [^7] |
| `defaultNetwork` | `solana` [^19] |
| `defaultAsset` | `USDC` (ticker-vs-UUID format unverified — open questions) |
| optional | `presetFiatAmount` (USD/CAD/GBP/EUR only; ignored if `presetCryptoAmount` set), `presetCryptoAmount`, `defaultExperience` (`buy`\|`send`), `defaultPaymentMethod`, `fiatCurrency`, `handlingRequestedUrls` [^6] |

## 7. Offramp URL builder (`Cdp::OfframpUrl`)

Base: `https://pay.coinbase.com/v3/sell/input` [^8]. **`sessionToken`, `partnerUserRef` (<50 chars), and `redirectUrl` are ALL required for offramp** [^8]. Optional: `defaultNetwork=solana`, `defaultAsset=USDC`, `presetCryptoAmount` XOR `presetFiatAmount`, `defaultCashoutMethod` (`FIAT_WALLET`|`CRYPTO_ACCOUNT`|`ACH_BANK_ACCOUNT`|`PAYPAL`), `fiatCurrency`, `disableEdit` [^8]. `redirectUrl` → `https://turfmonster.media/cdp/offramp/return`.

Alternative (later): `POST /onramp/v1/sell/quote` with `sourceAddress`, `redirectUrl`, `partnerUserId` returns a ready `offramp_url` + `quote_id` for one-click sell — note the **quote API uses `partnerUserId` while the URL/status APIs use `partnerUserRef`** [^9].

## 8. Routes + controllers

```ruby
scope :cdp do
  post "onramp_sessions",  to: "cdp/ramp_sessions#create_onramp"
  post "offramp_sessions", to: "cdp/ramp_sessions#create_offramp"
  get  "onramp/return",    to: "cdp/returns#onramp"
  get  "offramp/return",   to: "cdp/returns#offramp"
end
post "webhooks/cdp", to: "webhooks/cdp#create"  # phase 2
```

`Cdp::RampSessionsController`: `Cdp::BaseController` skips the normal HTML login redirect and enforces API auth directly across the CDP surface, so unauthenticated requests return `401` JSON for every requested format and can never redirect into a final `200` app page. `AppFlags.cdp_ramp?` still 404s the entire CDP surface when the flag is off. Geo gate (§13), then session-token POSTs create a `CdpRampTransaction` row → mint session token → build URL → `render json: { url: }`. Security requirements [^7]: strict explicit CORS only — production allowlist derives from `APP_HOST` plus `APP_HOST_ALIASES`, non-production also allows `http://localhost:3100`, optional override via `CDP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`; never wildcard. User auth is mandatory before minting — "you will be liable for any misuse of your endpoints". Reuse the existing Phase-1 general/ip rate-limit throttle on both endpoints.

`Cdp::ReturnsController`: marks `returned_at`, enqueues the relevant poll job, renders the status page. **The redirect carries NO documented query params — treat it as a UX-only signal, never as confirmation** [^6][^8].

## 9. Persistence — `CdpRampTransaction`

`user_id`, `direction` (enum onramp/offramp), `partner_user_ref` (unique index), `wallet_address`, `wallet_mode`, `status` (local lifecycle: `initiated → token_minted → returned → cdp_created → sending → sent → success | failed | expired | abandoned`, plus raw CDP status), `coinbase_transaction_id` (idempotency key for upserts), `tx_hash`, `to_address`, `sell_amount_value:decimal` / `sell_amount_currency`, `asset`, `network`, `payment_method`, `raw_payload:jsonb`, `cashout_deadline_at`, `sent_signature`, timestamps.

## 10. Offramp post-commit send — BOTH wallet modes

After the user clicks "Cash out now" in the widget, CDP creates a transaction whose `to_address` is "a Coinbase managed onchain address where funds are sent to be offramped" — **"Your app must facilitate this onchain transaction"** within the **30-minute window** [^10]. There is no redirect param carrying `to_address`; it comes only from the Offramp Transaction Status API [^10].

**Discovery (both modes):** `Cdp::OfframpPollJob` (§11) polls until a row with `status: TRANSACTION_STATUS_CREATED` appears; persist `to_address`, `sell_amount`, `network`, set `cashout_deadline_at = created_at + 30.minutes`.

**Managed mode (server signs):** new `Cdp::OfframpSendJob`:
- Build the USDC SPL transfer from the user's web2 ATA to `to_address`, mirroring `Solana::Vault#transfer_spl` (`app/services/solana/vault.rb:288`) but with **authority = the user's managed keypair** (`Solana::Keypair.from_encrypted`), mint = `Solana::Config::USDC_MINT` (mainnet `EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v`), amount = `BigDecimal(sell_amount.value) * 10**6` base units.
- `to_address` ambiguity: docs never say whether the Solana `to_address` is an owner address or a token account — inspect on-chain (owned by SPL Token program → use directly as token account; else derive its USDC ATA). Confirm on first mainnet sell (open questions).
- Guards: **fresh explicit user confirmation click in our UI before the server moves funds**; balance check; refuse sends past `cashout_deadline_at` minus a ~3-minute safety margin; record `sent_signature`; **verify signature status before any retry** (never blind-resend — same class of bug as the Lazarus `recover_pending_entry` finding).

**Phantom mode (client signs):** the offramp return page (plus a StateFanout-driven prompt) shows "Send X USDC to Coinbase" with a live countdown. Client builds the SPL transfer from the web3 ATA to `to_address`(/its ATA) using the existing wallet-adapter plumbing, Phantom signs, client broadcasts, then `POST`s the signature back so the poll job can reconcile. Copy must state the late-send rule: funds sent after 30 minutes still land in the user's **Coinbase crypto balance**, but the sell moves to `TRANSACTION_STATUS_FAILED` and won't auto-complete [^11].

## 11. Status polling (Sidekiq)

- **`Cdp::OfframpPollJob`** — `GET /onramp/v1/sell/user/{partner_user_ref}/transactions?page_size=50` (page_size **defaults to 1** — always pass it) [^10][^13]. Per docs: "avoid polling immediately after generating the URL; wait until the send transaction is created… using exponential backoff" [^11] — **start at session-mint time** (first poll ~60s after the URL is handed out, while the user is still inside the widget), then 10s → 30s → 1m → 2m → 5m, stop at terminal status or deadline + grace. The return-page hit *(re-)schedules* the same idempotent loop but must never be the only trigger — per the Risks section the redirect is broken by design as a signal (un-allowlisted domain or a closed tab silently drops it while the transaction completes), and offramp `to_address` discovery has to run regardless or the 30-minute cashout window lapses with no send. Status enum (API reference): `TRANSACTION_STATUS_CREATED | EXPIRED | STARTED | SUCCESS | FAILED`; the guide page lists only STARTED/SUCCESS/FAILED — handle unknown values defensively [^13]. Response fields used: `to_address`, `sell_amount`, `from_address`, `tx_hash`, `coinbase_fee` (null unless offramping to fiat). `transactions[]` is reverse chronological; with our per-session `partner_user_ref` the first row is ours [^13].
- **`Cdp::OnrampPollJob`** — `GET /onramp/v1/buy/user/{partner_user_ref}/transactions?page_size=50`. Statuses: `ONRAMP_TRANSACTION_STATUS_IN_PROGRESS | SUCCESS | FAILED`; `partner_user_ref` in the response "corresponds to the partnerUserRef parameter… in the Onramp URL" [^14]. On SUCCESS: update the ramp row and push a balance refresh via `window.StateFanout` (one new `register()` call).
- Both: upsert by `transaction_id`, idempotent, structured logging.

## 12. Webhooks (phase 2 — polling stays the authoritative baseline)

Event types: `onramp.transaction.{created,updated,success,failed}` and `offramp.transaction.{created,updated,success,failed}` [^12]. Registration is **CDP-CLI-only** (operator step). Payloads are camelCase (`eventType`, `status`, `paymentTotal{currency,value}`, `txHash`, `transactionId`, `partnerUserRef`) [^12]. `Webhooks::CdpController#create` modeled on the existing `Webhooks::StripeController`: verify signature per the standard CDP webhook verification flow (`/webhooks/verify-signatures`) with `CDP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, upsert by `transactionId`, trigger the same handlers as the poll jobs, return 200 fast. Full payload schema + retry policy are not formally documented — keep polling running regardless.

## 13. State/country gating (`Cdp::Catalog`)

- `GET /onramp/v1/buy/config` (no params) → `countries[] { id, subdivisions[] (US states only), payment_methods[] }`; `GET /onramp/v1/sell/config` — same shape for offramp [^15]. Docs: "call this API periodically and cache the response" [^15].
- `GET /onramp/v1/buy/options?country=US&subdivision=XX&networks=solana` — **subdivision is REQUIRED for country=US** ("certain states (e.g., NY) have state specific asset restrictions"); confirm USDC appears in `purchase_currencies` with a Solana network entry + read min/max per payment method. `GET /onramp/v1/sell/options?country=US&subdivision=XX&networks=solana` → `cashout_currencies[].limits` + `sell_currencies` for the sell side [^16].
- Implementation: `Rails.cache.fetch(..., expires_in: 12.hours)` **plus per-request `@ivar ||=` memoization** (dev null_store no-ops Rails.cache — existing house pattern). Gate the Buy/Cash-out buttons with the geo session `Studio::GeoDetection` resolves (country + subdivision); disable with an explainer when unsupported.
- At integration time, verify the network slug Solana reports in options/config responses (`"solana"` vs `"solana-mainnet"`-style strings appear in different doc examples) and whether buy-config nests under a `data` key [^15].

## 14. Frontend

- "Buy USDC" / "Cash out" buttons (wallet + balance surfaces), Alpine, gated on `AppFlags.cdp_ramp?` + geo + (sell) USDC balance > 0.
- Click → authedFetch POST to our session endpoint → `window.open(url, "_blank")` popup or new tab. **Never iframe — explicitly unsupported** [^11]. Hosted URLs break inside WebViews (passkeys/WebAuthn) — fine for our plain web app, note for any future wrapper [^11].
- Offramp pre-flight modal must state up front: **a Coinbase account with a linked payout method is required (guest checkout is not supported for fiat withdrawal)** [^11], and the 30-minute send window.
- Onramp copy should assume Coinbase login: guest checkout via the hosted widget is **deprecated June 30, 2026** [^20]. Fee transparency: spread + Coinbase fee on order preview, 2.5% card / 0.5% ACH, network fee estimate; zero-fee USDC only via rep-gated subsidy program [^11].

## 15. Testing

- Unit (minitest + WebMock): JWT round-trip decode (alg/kid/nonce/claims incl. `uri`), 64-byte key validation, URL builders (required-param enforcement, <50-char ref), poll-job state machine, managed-send guards, catalog gating. Grep `test/test_helper.rb` before adding helpers.
- Sandbox `https://pay-sandbox.coinbase.com/?sessionToken=...` covers **only the guest-checkout debit-card flow** (card `4242 4242 4242 4242` = success, any other 16-digit = decline, any 6-digit SMS code) — limited value given the deprecation [^21]. Production widget hidden mock: click the word "Secured" 10 times → Debug Menu → "Enable Mocked Buy and Send" [^21].
- **Real end-to-end (especially offramp + the `to_address` question) is mainnet-only with real funds** — plan a small operator-run smoke test (see operator steps). The `"sandbox-"` `partnerUserRef` prefix applies only to the v2 sessions API [^17].

---

## Operator steps (CDP portal — human-only)

1. **Account + project.** Go to https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com and sign in / create the CDP account. Create a project (or pick one from the **top-left project dropdown**). Click the **gear icon** → project details → copy the **Project ID** into 1Password (not needed for the REST JWT auth, but webhook subscriptions and SDK configs reference it).
2. **Secret API Key.** Go to https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/projects/api-keys → select the **Secret API Key** tab — NOT Client API Key ("Client API Keys are for client-side JSON-RPC requests and will not work with Onramp/Offramp REST APIs"). Create key: nickname `turf-monster-ramp-prod`, signature algorithm **Ed25519 (recommended)**, skip IP restrictions (Heroku dynos have no stable egress IPs). Copy the **key ID (UUID)** and **secret (base64)** from the modal.
3. **Store the secret.** 1Password entry (per existing OPSEC pattern), then locally `bin/setup-cdp-key` (clipboard → .env), and `heroku config:set CDP_API_KEY_ID=… CDP_API_KEY_SECRET=… -a turf-monster-mainnet` via the pbpaste secret-paste workflow — never paste the secret inline into an agent-visible terminal.
4. **Domain allowlist.** Portal → **Payments → Onramp & Offramp** (https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/onramp) → Domain Allowlist → add `https://turfmonster.media` and keep `https://app.turfmonster.media` until all legacy links/provider callbacks are migrated. Set the optional **Display Name** ("Turf Monster") — it appears on the order preview and the post-purchase redirect countdown/button.
5. **Localhost dev story.** Try adding `http://localhost:3100` to the same allowlist. Docs only require allowlisting for *production* redirect URLs and the quickstart uses a bare localhost redirectUrl in dev; if the portal rejects localhost, dev still works — the post-transaction redirect is just silently skipped (the transaction itself completes). Report which outcome you got so the build can finalize the dev return-page story.
6. **Trial mode.** Nothing to click — new integrations start in trial mode automatically. Note: no numeric trial limits are published anywhere.
7. **Full-access application.** Complete the onboarding form at https://support.cdp.coinbase.com/onramp-onboarding (app: turfmonster.media, USDC on Solana, hosted integration). Record whatever trial limits / review timeline they state — both are undocumented.
8. **Zero-fee USDC.** There is no self-serve link; the FAQ says zero-fee USDC onramping is a subsidy program for select partners — "Contact your account representative." Raise it in the onboarding form notes and/or with CDP support/Discord, and record the answer.
9. **Webhooks (only when phase 2 starts).** From the Mac: `npm install -g @coinbase/cdp-cli`, auth with `cdp env live --key-file ./cdp_api_key.json`, then create the subscription for `onramp.transaction.*` + `offramp.transaction.*` targeting `https://turfmonster.media/webhooks/cdp`. The 201 response contains `metadata.secret` **once** — store in 1Password + `heroku config:set CDP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=…`.
10. **Launch flag.** When the build + smoke test are ready: `heroku config:set ENABLE_CDP_RAMP=true -a turf-monster-mainnet`. Unset it as the kill-switch.
11. **Mainnet smoke test (operator-run, real money).** FIRST item, before any money moves: verify a GET **with query params** (e.g. `GET /onramp/v1/buy/options?country=US&subdivision=CA&networks=solana`) returns 200 against the live API — this proves the JWT `uri`-claim path-only binding (§3); a query-signing bug 401s every poll/catalog call while the query-less `POST /onramp/v1/token` keeps working. Then one small buy (~$10 USDC, Coinbase login) to your own wallet, then one small sell from a managed-wallet test user using your Coinbase account with a linked bank. This is the only way to verify the offramp `to_address` semantics (owner address vs token account), the redirect behavior, and end-to-end status polling — there is no testnet for onramp/offramp.

## Risks

- Offramp hard-requires a Coinbase account with a linked payout method — "Guest checkout is not supported for fiat withdrawal." Some players simply cannot cash out via this path; the UI must say so before they start.
- Guest Checkout via the hosted widget (debit card / Apple Pay without a Coinbase account) is deprecated June 30, 2026. Onramp must be designed as Coinbase-login-first; supporting wallet-less buyers later means a separate Headless Onramp build.
- No testnet: onramp delivers real mainnet USDC and offramp moves real funds. The offramp loop (to_address discovery + send + settlement) can only be verified with real money on prod.
- Offramp 30-minute send window: funds sent late still land in the user's Coinbase crypto balance but the sell goes TRANSACTION_STATUS_FAILED and never auto-completes — guaranteed support tickets without an aggressive countdown UX and clear copy.
- Managed-wallet offramp is a server-signed movement of user funds to an externally supplied address. Requires a fresh explicit user confirmation, amount/destination guards, deadline cut-off, and verify-before-retry (a blind retry after an RPC timeout double-sends USDC irrecoverably).
- redirectUrl is UX-only: no documented query params on return, and an un-allowlisted domain makes the redirect silently no-op while the transaction still completes — any confirmation logic hung off the redirect is broken by design. Monitor returned_at rates to catch allowlist regressions.
- Trial-mode limits are completely unpublished (the $500/week / 15-lifetime figures are Guest Checkout USER limits, a different concept) and the full-access review timeline is unknown.
- clientIp tension on Heroku: docs say never trust X-Forwarded-For, but Heroku only delivers the client IP via XFF; we send request.remote_ip and accept the documented anti-pattern.
- Casing/naming traps: camelCase request bodies, snake_case v1 responses, camelCase webhooks; partnerUserRef (URLs + status APIs) vs partnerUserId (sell quote API). Easy to ship a silent correlation-breaking mismatch.
- jwt-eddsa is a third-party gem (anakinj) on the signing path for the CDP secret key — pin the version and watch updates.
- No documented rate limit for POST /onramp/v1/token — keep our own per-user throttle on the mint endpoints and handle 429 rate_limit_exceeded defensively.
- Phantom-mode offramp has a mandatory manual post-redirect send step — expect drop-off and stranded EXPIRED/CREATED rows; needs abandoned-state handling and re-entry UX within the 30-minute window.
- Phantom/Blowfish previously flagged turfmonster domains as malicious (de-list in progress) — Phantom may show scare warnings on the offramp send signature, killing conversion for web3 users until the de-list lands.
- User-facing fees (spread + Coinbase fee, 2.5% card / 0.5% ACH, network fee) make small buys expensive; zero-fee USDC is rep-gated — pricing copy must not promise fee-free until granted.
- Token-minting endpoint liability: Coinbase explicitly holds the developer liable for misuse of an improperly secured session-token endpoint — auth gating, no wildcard CORS, and rate limiting are compliance requirements, not nice-to-haves.

## Open questions (resolve during build/smoke test)

1. clientIp required vs optional — two docs pages conflict. Build sends request.remote_ip always; confirm against the live API.
2. Offramp status enum conflict: API reference says CREATED | EXPIRED | STARTED | SUCCESS | FAILED; the guide lists only STARTED/SUCCESS/FAILED; the FAQ says late sends go FAILED. Confirm which status appears first after "Cash out now" (CREATED expected — it gates our send trigger) and when EXPIRED vs FAILED is set.
3. Solana to_address semantics for offramp sends: owner address (derive USDC ATA) vs SPL token account (use directly)? No doc says. Resolve on the first mainnet sell BEFORE enabling managed-wallet auto-send for real users.
4. No verbatim session-token example with blockchains:["solana"] exists in docs — verify the token mints and the widget shows USDC-on-Solana on the first real call.
5. What (if anything) is appended to redirectUrl on completion — **ANSWERED (2026-06-10, empirical):** Coinbase appends `?onramp_result=success` on a successful buy (observed on a localhost return). Other result values unverified; return pages still key everything off partner_user_ref polling (unchanged).
6. Can localhost be added to the Onramp/Offramp domain allowlist? **ANSWERED (2026-06-10, empirical):** the localhost redirect fired and landed on `/cdp/onramp/return` in dev — local return-page testing works.
7. Trial-mode numeric limits + full-access review timeline — capture during operator onboarding. **PARTIALLY ANSWERED (2026-06-10, empirical):** trial mode caps GUEST checkout at **$5/week** (widget copy: "Buy up to $5/week or create a Coinbase account for higher limits") — below a single $19 entry, so full access is a launch blocker for wallet-less buyers. Normal (non-trial) guest cap is $500/week. Coinbase-account buys have higher limits even in trial (per the widget's own upsell). Full-access review timeline still unknown.
8. Network slug naming in config/options responses ("solana" vs "solana-mainnet") and whether buy-config nests under a "data" key — verify against live GET /onramp/v1/buy/options?country=US&networks=solana before wiring Cdp::Catalog parsing.
9. defaultPaymentMethod accepted string set and defaultAsset format (ticker "USDC" vs Coinbase asset UUID) — test with ticker first.
10. Whether POST /onramp/v1/token shares the quote APIs' 10 req/s throttle; exact error shape for a reused/expired session token; whether the 5-minute TTL runs creation→URL-open or longer.
11. Is the nonce JWT header strictly enforced server-side? Always sending SecureRandom.hex(16). Also unverified: the downloaded API key file's JSON shape, and whether ECDSA still appears in the portal key-creation flow (the zero-new-gem fallback depends on it).
12. Confirm no v2 sessions equivalent ships for OFFRAMP before building (v1 token flow is the documented path).
13. Offramp fee schedule for USDC — verify coinbase_fee on a real POST /onramp/v1/sell/quote before writing cash-out fee copy.
14. Webhook payload full schema + delivery retry policy — undocumented; whether Buy/Sell Options min/max differ between trial mode and full access.
15. Payout timing to bank/PayPal after a successful sell (consumer help says ACH 1–5 business days) — needed for cash-out expectations copy.
