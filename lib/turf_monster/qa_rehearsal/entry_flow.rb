    # Enters one cast member into one contest, over HTTP, exactly as a browser

    #
    # Deliberately the SLOW path. `Solana::Vault#enter_contest` could put an
    # entry on-chain in one server-side call, but it would skip everything this
    # rehearsal exists to exercise: assert_enterable!, the lock-time check, the
    # exactly-picks_required rule, the per-user limit, the duplicate-combo rule,
    # and the sybil check. A rehearsal that avoided the gates would certify a
    # pipeline nobody actually runs.
    #
    # The signature seam is the only place this differs from a real player: the
    # wire that comes back from #prepare_entry is FULLY unsigned (the admin is
    # reserved as fee-payer but does not sign until confirm time), so the driver
    # fills only the player's slot and leaves the admin's empty — which is why
    # it passes `require_complete: false`. The server cosigns, simulates,
    # broadcasts and verifies, precisely as it does for Phantom.

      # START FROM A KNOWN-EMPTY CART.
      #
      # This step used to skip clear_picks deliberately, because clear_picks
      # abandoned the cart entry while LEAVING its entry_number set, and the
      # allocator would then hand the same number back into a partial unique
      # index that still counted the abandoned row. Calling it was the one move
      # that made this step permanently un-rerunnable.
      #
      # That app bug is fixed — Entry releases the slot on abandon, except when
      # the row carries an on-chain signature (see Entry#release_slot_if_abandoned).
      # So the workaround is retired, and retiring it FIXES a defect of its own:
      # toggle_selection TOGGLES, so a re-run over a partial cart turned the
      # existing picks OFF and errored, and a third run oscillated. Clearing
      # first is what makes this step re-runnable, which is the whole reason an
      # operator can watch it fail and simply run it again.
      #
      # WHAT THE CLEAR CAN STILL ABANDON. The signature exception above is about
      # the SLOT, and it does not fire for the strand this step is most likely to
      # meet. If a previous run broadcast an entry and then failed verification,
      # the cart row it left is paid on-chain with no signature of its own — the
      # signature is stamped on the PendingTransaction
      # (ContestsController#confirm_onchain_entry), never on the entry — so the
      # clear abandons it AND releases its number. Abandoning is not losing it:
      # Entries::OnchainReconciler admits an abandoned row when a
      # PendingTransaction targeting it carries a broadcast signature, then
      # recovers the PDA and the consume signature from the chain. Two limits are
      # worth knowing before you rely on that. It converges a row only while the
      # contest is still open and unlocked, because it heals through
      # Entry#confirm! → #assert_enterable! — so a strand must be reconciled
      # before Step 3, which is where the lock actually lands (Driver#
      # play_preseason → #lock_contest: a contest locks at kickoff and THEN the
      # games play). Step 4's #conclude re-locks only as a backstop for a run
      # that skipped Step 3, and Driver warns in prose against reading the lock
      # as living there. And nothing schedules it —
      # config/schedule.yml does not register Entries::OnchainReconcileJob, which
      # test/services/entries/onchain_reconciler_test.rb pins so that scheduling
      # it later cannot leave this paragraph lying. Heal a strand by hand with
      # `bin/rails entries:reconcile_onchain[<contest-slug>]`, which reaches the
      # named contest whatever its status.
      #
      # CHECK THE ANSWER. WalletSession#post_json returns whatever the server
      # said — it does not raise on a 4xx — so a refused clear comes back as
      # `{ "success" => false, "error" => ... }` from a 422 and reads exactly
      # like a success to anyone who discards it. This call used to, and was
      # the only one in the flow that did; the flow then built picks onto a
      # cart it had not cleared and ran to completion, which is precisely the
      # oscillation the clear exists to prevent.
      #
      # Presence of `error`, not truthiness of `success`, mirroring build_cart:
      # clear_picks answers `{ success: true }` even when there was no cart to
      # clear, and parse_json answers `{}` for an empty body — so an
      # error-presence check cannot refuse a clear that actually succeeded.
