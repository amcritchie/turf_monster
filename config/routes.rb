  # THIS LINE STAYS, and /tasks/adopt-engine-phantom-deeplink VERIFIED that
  # rather than assuming it. The adoption deleted this app's fork of the
  # callback VIEW so the engine's renders instead, but the ROUTE is still this
  # app's, for two independent reasons:
  #
  #   1. The engine's own declaration sits behind `Studio.draw_auth_routes &&
  #      Studio.auth_method?(:wallet)`, and config/initializers/studio.rb sets
  #      draw_auth_routes = false (this app draws its own auth set). So the
  #      engine never draws it here at all.
  #   2. Even with that flag on it would lose. Studio.routes draws the OmniAuth
  #      wildcard `auth/:provider/callback` UNCONDITIONALLY and EARLIER in the
  #      same block, so a phantom callback drawn after it recognises as
  #      omniauth_callbacks#create with provider "phantom".
  #
  # Deleting this line therefore does not hand the engine control; it 404s
  # every mobile Phantom sign-in. The controller action is this app's too
  # (SolanaSessionsController#phantom_callback, client-side only) — a host
  # controller wins over the engine's, and only the view was adopted.

  # (ApplicationController#capture_reference) and ?email= prefill survive the hop.
