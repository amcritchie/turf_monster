  # The app's default contest target, resolved ONCE per request. THE ONE ENTRY
  # POINT any view may use to reach SeasonConfig.main_contest — the referral
  # card's share link, the age gate's watch CTA, the locked-username CTA, the
  # next-quest links. Nothing in a render calls SeasonConfig.main_contest
  # directly; that is the whole point of this method existing.
  #
  # WHY THE CALL LIVES IN A RENDER AT ALL. These cards are rendered by
  # controllers that cannot preload for them. The referral card is on two pages
  # and only one has a host controller — the engine's ProfilesController renders
  # it on /profile and cannot be taught to set a host ivar. The modal cards are
  # worse: layouts/application registers them inside `<template x-if>` blocks,
  # and ERB inside a `<template>` renders SERVER-SIDE unconditionally, so the
  # x-if gates the BROWSER and never the server. Those cards resolve on every
  # authenticated page whether or not their modal is ever opened.
  #
  # THAT IS WHAT NEEDS CONTAINING. SeasonConfig.main_contest reaches
  # SeasonConfig.current, which is a `find_or_create_by` — normally a SELECT, but
  # a code path that can INSERT, and a view render is the wrong place to have one
  # at all. It also falls through to a Contest scan when the admin's pick is not
  # open, so each call is up to three queries. Memoising here keeps the whole
  # render to one resolution however many cards ask, and gives the call one named
  # home instead of being loose in five templates. A memo local to any single
  # caller would not help: most of them ask exactly once per render, so it would
  # look like a fix while changing nothing.
  #
  # `defined?` rather than `||=`, so a legitimately nil result (no open contest —
  # the off-season) is cached instead of re-queried on every call. Same idiom as
  # ApplicationController#display_seeds_data.
