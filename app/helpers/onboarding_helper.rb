  # first-name card types a different one each time it opens.
  #
  # FIRST NAMES ONLY, and that is the whole point: the field asks for a first
  # name, so the example has to BE one. It also keeps the list from reading as a
  # roster — a player's presence here is a writing sample, not a claim about a
  # depth chart.
  #
  # WHY A HARD-CODED LIST. Turf has no NFL player data to draw on: the `players`
  # table holds World Cup soccer players (Messi, Vinícius…), and the NFL side of
  # the app is team-totals only. So this is a constant, and constants about live
  # rosters go stale — a starter gets hurt in week 2 and this list is wrong until
  # someone edits it. That is acceptable for a placeholder (nothing branches on
  # it, and a retired starter is still a real first name) but it is the reason
  # this lives in ONE named place instead of being sprinkled through a view.
  #
  # Duplicates are fine and not deduped: two Joshes make Josh twice as likely,
  # which is a fair reflection of how common the name is.

  # studio-engine's first-name card defaults to a SHORTER line ("...we use it to
  # address you in emails."). Turf has always named what the emails are about,
  # and the entry-gate variant has always said WHY it is asking now. Letting the
  # gem default win would have quietly dropped both clauses in an adoption whose
  # whole job was to change nothing a user sees, so both strings are carried
  # across verbatim from the deleted app/views/modals/_onboarding.html.erb.

  # Locals for studio/modals/onboarding/first_name, shared by BOTH host
  # registration lists — layouts/application (the live app) and
  # layouts/modal_preview (the /admin/modals gallery). They are separate lists by
  # design, so a value written inline twice is a value free to drift; this is the
  # same seam web3_step_up_locals already provides for that card, and the
  # preview layout's own note records that an inline copy is exactly where the
  # wallet card drifted before.
  #
  # `required` hides both skip affordances. The gem resolves it at RENDER time
  # rather than from the Alpine store, which is why the layouts register two
  # branches keyed on the caller's prop instead of one card — see the
  # registration comment in layouts/application.html.erb.
  #
  # NOT PASSED, because each gem default is already character-identical to the
  # markup this replaced: heading ("What should we call you?"), max_length
  # (Studio::FULL_NAME_MAX_LENGTH), submit_path, skip_path, the field id and
  # done_event. onboarding_gallery_test pins the rendered heading so a future gem
  # default cannot move turf's copy in silence.
