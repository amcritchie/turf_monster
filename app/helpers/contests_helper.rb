  # ── The status badge the contests page paints ────────────────────────────
  #
  # Three states this page adds on top of the plain status enum:
  #
  #   Coming Soon  an open contest flagged `coming_soon` — advertised, not
  #                ready yet. It says so wherever the contest is listed, so a
  #                table's Status column can never contradict the rail's sash
  #                about the same contest on the same screen.
  #   Won          a settled contest this viewer took money out of.
  #   Complete     a settled contest this viewer entered and did not.
  #
  # `payout_cents` is the axis that separates those last two, and NIL IS A
  # THIRD ANSWER, not a zero. Nil means "not asked on behalf of any particular
  # viewer" — the All Contests table, which keeps the plain "Settled" it has
  # always shown. Only the My Contests band passes a number, and only there is
  # a settled contest told apart into Won and Complete.
  #
  # Won is the ONE FILLED badge on the page. Everything else takes the house
  # outline treatment, so the row a reader actually won reads differently at a
  # glance instead of being a second green outline beside Open's. Contrast:
  # mint-500 (#06D6A0) under navy (#1A1535) text measures 9.34:1, and both are
  # fixed brand hues rather than theme tokens, so that figure holds in the
  # light theme as well as the dark one.
  #
  # PRECEDENCE, and why each guard comes before the ones it would otherwise
  # swallow: cancelled first (terminal whatever else is true, and the fact that
  # changes what the reader should do next), then the settled pair (a settled
  # contest is never coming soon and its status branch would just say
  # "Settled"), then coming soon, then the plain status.
  def contest_status_badge(contest, payout_cents: nil)

  # ── The ribbon laid across a contest card ────────────────────────────────
  #
  # Returns the sash's text, or nil when the card should not carry one — most
  # cards do not, which is what makes the ones that do worth looking at.
  #
  # `my_entry_count` is THIS VIEWER'S entry count, not the contest's. The card
  # already prints the field size ("15 entries") in its stat line, so a sash
  # repeating that number would say nothing; what it is for is the reader's own
  # stake. One entry says "Entered" because a count of one adds nothing to it.
  #
  # Coming soon OUTRANKS entered. The two can co-occur — nothing stops an
  # operator flagging a contest that already has entries — and "not ready yet"
  # is the more urgent claim about a contest a reader is looking at now.
  def contest_sash_label(contest, my_entry_count)

  end

  # ── How much room is left in the field ───────────────────────────────────
  #
  # The card's stat line reports SPOTS LEFT rather than entries taken, because
  # the two numbers answer different questions and only one of them is the
  # reader's. "0 entries" on a brand-new contest reads as "nobody wants this";
  # "3 spots left" on the same contest reads as "get in". The field size is
  # still on the contest page itself (`_contest_header` row 2 prints n/max),
  # where a reader who is deciding has the room for both halves.
  #
  # `entry_count` is passed IN — the confirmed count the controller already
  # grouped for the whole page — so the card never triggers its own count query
  # per row. The capacity is the contest's own `max_entries` when the operator
  # set one, and its format's default otherwise; the same fallback pair
  # Contest#fill! and the on-chain payload use.
  #
  # Clamped at zero. An over-filled field (comped entries can push the count
  # past the cap — see Contest#fill!) must read "0 spots left", never a negative
  # count, and "0 spots left" is the true statement in that case anyway.
  def contest_spots_left(contest, entry_count)
    capacity = contest.max_entries || contest.format_config[:max_entries]
    [capacity.to_i - entry_count.to_i, 0].max

  #   settled, won        the amount THIS VIEWER won, green — the pool is
  #                       history, their share is the fact.
  #   settled, won none   the guaranteed pool, GREY. The number is kept rather
  #                       than blanked because "$500 was on the table" is the
  #                       point; the grey is what says it went elsewhere.

  # The sample messages the composer TYPES into its placeholder while the "Send
  # Your First Message" quest is live (contests/_chat_panel, driven by the quest
  # card's quest-chat-active event).
  #
  # SEMI-STATIC by design: two fixed openers, then one line built from this
  # viewer's own entry. The composer types the three in order and RESTS on the
  # last one, so the line left sitting in the placeholder is the personal one —
  # the reader's own longshot, named. Three is therefore the whole deck, not a
  # truncation: every line here is one the viewer actually sees.

  # 375px breakpoint (the mobile chat tab), the textarea's content box is 206px
  # against a 20px line-height in a 22px box: a longer line WRAPS and gets sliced
  # mid-glyph rather than ellipsised. It also overflows the md two-column box
  # (223px) and only clears at 1024px+.
  #
  # So the name carries a budget — and 10, not the 14 a single measurement first
  # suggested. THE CONTENT BOX IS NOT THE SAME WIDTH EVERYWHERE: 206px measured
  # in Chrome on macOS, but 183px on the Linux CI runner, whose classic scrollbar
  # takes real width where macOS overlay scrollbars take none. A budget tuned to
  # the roomier box shipped a line that overflowed on the narrower one — CI caught
  # "United States light it up ✈️" at 187.0px in a 183.0px box. 10 is the widest
  # REAL name that clears the narrow box with margin ("Commanders", "Buccaneers",
  # "Uzbekistan"); the 11-13 character names are all countries with clean
  # three-letter short_names ("United States" -> "USA"), which read well here.
  # Above that lies "Bosnia and Herzegovina" (22) and the World Cup bracket
  # placeholders ("Runner-up Match 101"), which read badly in this sentence

  # What the live board should CALL itself, given the contest's state.
  #
  # The page renders in every state now (a link an operator has should work),
  # but its header said "Live" with a pulsing red dot unconditionally — so a
  # contest that had not kicked off, and one that had already paid out, both
  # announced themselves as in progress. The badge is the first thing read on
  # that page; a badge that is wrong is worse than no badge.
  #
  # THE STATE SPACE IS NOT AN ENUM, AND IT IS NOT THREE AXES EITHER. Two fixes
  # have now been made here by enumerating the axes their author knew about and
  # missing the next one. So enumerate them all, and say which pairings cannot
  # occur — a branch that silently assumes a state is unreachable is how both
  # earlier bugs survived review.
  #
  # FIVE PREDICATES ARE READ ABOUT A CONTEST. Only FOUR of them are free:
  #
  #   status      enum, pending/open/settled           (contest.rb:44)
  #   cancelled?  onchain_cancelled, a boolean column  (contest.rb:498)
  #   locked?     settled? || now >= starts_in_at      (contest.rb:586)
  #   concluded?  settled? || now >= concludes_at      (contest.rb:594)
  #   live?       locked? && !settled?                 (contest.rb:602)
  #
  # `live?` IS NOT AN AXIS. It is a derived reading of two others, and it carries
  # NO conclusion term — which is the whole of this bug: a contest that has
  # concluded but not been graded still satisfies `locked? && !settled?`, so it
  # answered `live?` true and the badge pulsed "Live" at results that were final.
  # The previous round of this same bug was the same shape with `cancelled?`.
  #
  # WHAT IS REACHABLE (settled forces both derived flags true, so it is listed
  # once; `pending`/`open` behave alike here — neither is read directly):
  #
  #   status         cancelled?  locked?  concluded?   label
  #   ---------------------------------------------------------------
  #   pending/open   no          no       no           Not started
  #   pending/open   no          yes      no           Live
  #   pending/open   no          yes      yes          Concluded  <- read "Live"
  #   pending/open   no          no       yes          Concluded  <- read "Not started"
  #   pending/open   yes         any      any          Cancelled
  #   settled        no          (forced) (forced)     Final
  #   settled        yes         (forced) (forced)     Cancelled
  #
  # WHAT IS NOT REACHABLE, and why — do not add a branch for these:
  #
  #   settled + !locked?     `locked?` returns true unconditionally when
  #                          `settled?` (contest.rb:587). No clock value changes it.
  #   settled + !concluded?  Same shape: `concluded?` returns true unconditionally
  #                          when `settled?` (contest.rb:595) — even with
  #                          `concludes_at` nil or in the FUTURE. Pinned by
  #                          test/models/contest_locking_test.rb:84.
  #   live? + settled?       Excluded by `live?`'s own definition.
  #   live? + !locked?       Excluded by `live?`'s own definition.
  #
  # The fourth row — concluded but NOT locked — looks contradictory and is not.
  # On chain, `set_contest_conclusion_time` requires a conclusion later than the
  # lock ONLY when a lock is set (`lock != 0`,
  # programs/turf_vault/src/instructions/set_contest_conclusion_time.rs:71-74).
  # The chain sees `starts_in_at` ONCE, at create: it is mirrored into
  # `lock_timestamp` (contest.rb:526) and passed to create_contest
  # (contest.rb:265). Nothing re-reads it afterwards, and no validation couples
  # `concludes_at` to it — confirm_conclusion_time writes `concludes_at` ALONE
  # (contests_controller.rb:1404). So the PAIR is unconstrained after create: a
  # contest made with no slate schedule (lock 0, conclusion then unconstrained)
  # that is later given one, or one whose first game is POSTPONED past a
  # conclusion that has already passed, lands concluded-and-not-locked — and
  # before this fix it read "Not started" at a contest whose results were final.
  # It cannot be created that way outright: a conclusion must be in the FUTURE
  # when set (same file, :70), so it reaches the past only by elapsed time.
  #
  # PRECEDENCE: cancelled, then final, then concluded, then live, then upcoming.
  #
  #   cancelled first  — terminal whatever else is true, and it is the fact that
  #                      changes what the viewer should do next.
  #   final next       — a settled contest is ALSO concluded and ALSO locked by
  #                      definition (above), so anything checked before `final`
  #                      would swallow every settled contest.
  #   concluded next   — this is the fix. `live?` has no conclusion term, so a
  #                      concluded, ungraded contest reaches `live` unless
  #                      `concluded?` is asked first.
  #   live, upcoming   — what is left once the terminal and final-results states
  #                      are spoken for.
  #
  # Do NOT read "Cancelled" as "refunded": cancel_contest returns the prize pool
  # to the CREATOR (Solana::Vault#build_cancel_contest), entry fees stay operator
  # revenue, and entrant compensation is a manual mint_entry_token playbook.
  # Terms promise a refund only for a contest cancelled BEFORE it locks, which is
  # not the case this branch exists for. An entrant reading "Cancelled" may still
  # be owed money — which is the reason the badge must not read "Live" at them.
  #
  # "Concluded" makes a NARROWER claim than "Final", and the difference is load
  # bearing. It says the games are over and the result will not change; it does
  # NOT say the contest is graded or that anyone has been paid.
  #
  # Do not upgrade that into "concluded always comes before final". It does not:
  # `settle_contest` requires that the lock OR the conclusion has passed
  # (turf_vault/src/instructions/settle_contest.rs:103-106), so a contest with a
  # passed lock can be settled having never concluded. Concluding is one of two
  # ways to open the settle gate, not a stage every contest passes through.
  # "Concluded" therefore means "waiting on the payout", never "paid", and never
  # "the step before Final".
  #
  # THE BADGE NO LONGER TRACKS `live?`, AND MUST NOT BE MADE TO AGAIN. It was
  # documented as carrying "the same predicate the broadcast filters on", so
  # that it told you whether an update could arrive. That is what produced the
  # bug: cancel-while-locked is deliberately supported, `live?` is
  # `locked? && !settled?`, and Contest::LiveBroadcast selects `status: [:open]`
  # then `.select(&:live?)` — neither filter excludes a cancelled contest. So a
  # cancelled, locked contest IS still in the broadcast set while this badge
  # reads "Cancelled". That divergence is deliberate: the badge is a claim about
  # what the contest IS, not about whether packets are still being pushed at the
  # games strip below it.
  #
  # MOTION IS RESERVED FOR `live`. The pulsing dot is the one animated element
  # here, and it means exactly one thing: this contest is in progress. Every
  # terminal, finished, or not-yet state is static, so "is it moving?" stays a
  # reliable read at a glance. Cancelled keeps the app's cancelled red (it
  # matches CONTEST_BADGE_STYLES["cancelled"]) but takes a solid dot, never a
  # pulse. Concluded takes the app's conclusion ORANGE — the same tone the
  # header countdown lands on when it finishes ("🏁 Concluded", tone "orange" in
  # contests/_timestamp_countdown.html.erb) — so the two places that report a
  # conclusion agree on colour, and neither can be mistaken for live's red.
  #
  # Contrast, measured on the rendered page rather than computed from the
  # palette (rasterised pixel vs the actual `bg-page`, sanity-checked against
  # white-on-black = 21:1): text-orange-400 is 7.34:1 on the dark theme and
  # 2.27:1 on the light one. The dark figure BEATS the text-red-400 that live
  # and cancelled already use (6.05:1); the light figure trails it (2.76:1).
  # Light mode is below AA for every state in this row, orange included — that
  # is a pre-existing property of the row, not something the concluded state
  # introduced, and fixing it means re-toning live and cancelled too. If you do
  # that, note text-orange-500 measures EXACTLY at red-400's parity in both
  # themes (6.05 / 2.76) and is the drop-in; it was passed over here only
  # because 400 is the house label shade (label-400 over dot-500) and is the
  # tone the countdown above already lands on.
  #
  # This badge is server-rendered at page load. Contest::LiveBroadcast replaces
  # the games strip and the focus panel, not this header, so a contest whose
  # state changes under a viewer keeps the label it was drawn with until a
  # reload. Out of scope here; do not read these labels as self-correcting.
  # Every utility below is written as a FULL LITERAL. Tailwind scans this file
  # (config/tailwind.config.js content includes ./app/helpers/**/*.rb) but it
  # only ever matches whole class names — a class assembled by interpolation
  # compiles to no rule at all and the dot renders transparent.
