  # "All contests on chain" enforcement (2026-05-17 GTM principle):
  # every Contest is backed by an on-chain Contest PDA on turf-vault.
  #
  # PRIMARY PATH — Phantom-funded (default for the /contests/new UI):
  #   ContestsController#create builds a partially-signed `create_contest`
  #   TX (admin pays SOL rent, creator slot left for Phantom). The user signs
  #   in their wallet, then ContestsController#finalize WRITES THE ROW FIRST —
  #   `status: :pending`, carrying the derived PDA, `skip_onchain_callback =
  #   true` — broadcasts, stamps the signature, verifies, and only then
  #   promotes the row to `open`. The row is therefore created BEFORE
  #   onchain_tx_signature exists; `pending` means "written, not yet verified".
  #   See app/views/contests/new.html.erb + Solana::Vault#build_create_contest,
  #   and the ordering contract at the head of ContestsController#finalize.
  #
  # FALLBACK PATH — server-funded (Rails console / operator scripts):
  #   `Contest.create!(...)` without `skip_onchain_callback = true` fires
  #   the after_create callback below, which calls `create_onchain!` →
  #   Solana::Vault#create_contest_server_funded. Admin signs as both
  #   payer + creator and funds the prize pool from custodial USDC. If the
  #   on-chain leg fails, the DB row is destroyed and the exception
  #   re-raised — so `create!` is atomic across DB + chain.
  #
  # Opt-out via `skip_onchain_callback = true`:
  #   - The Phantom-funded UI flow sets this on save (Contest is already on-chain).
  #   - Test fixtures + Rails tests (Rails.env.test? auto-skips).
  #
  # THE HAZARD, because the two paths meet here and the cost is real money:
  # a Phantom-funded row that reaches this callback WITHOUT the opt-out
  # broadcasts a SECOND `create_contest` — the creator's prize pool from their
  # wallet, then another from the HOUSE wallet. Three things happen to prevent
  # it (the flag, `onchain?` being true once the PDA is set, and
  # `create_onchain!`'s own `return if onchain?`), which is three more than the
  # one a reader should have to find. Pinned by
  # test/controllers/contests_finalize_write_ordering_test.rb.

  # ── The featured rail's contents and order ───────────────────────────────
  #
  # The contests page leads with a horizontal rail of the contests a reader can
  # act on. This method decides BOTH which contests are in it and what order
  # they sit in, so the page and its tests read one definition.
  #
  # WHAT IS IN IT: the live board. A `settled` contest is finished — it belongs
  # in My Contests (where its result is the point) and in the All Contests
  # table, never in the rail that exists to advertise what is playable. A
  # CANCELLED contest is excluded for the same reason and is NOT the same test:
  # `cancelled?` reads the `onchain_cancelled` boolean, and a cancelled contest
  # keeps `status: "open"` (contest.rb #cancelled?), so filtering on status
  # alone would put a dead contest at the top of the page under a red badge.
  #
  # THE ORDER IS TWO BANDS, NOT ONE SORT KEY. Open first, coming-soon after,
  # each band newest-to-oldest. Expressed as a tuple so the band always
  # outranks the date: a coming-soon contest created this morning still sits
  # below an open contest created last month, because the reader scanning left
  # to right is looking for something to enter and everything enterable should
  # come first.
  #
  # `-created_at.to_i` reverses the date WITHIN the band without a second sort
  # pass. Whole seconds are enough: two contests created in the same second tie
  # and fall back to sort_by's order, which is a stable no-op here — nothing
  # downstream reads the order of a tie.
  #
  # Takes an ARRAY, not a relation, because the caller (ContestsController
  # #index) has already loaded every open/settled contest with its slate and
  # banner attached. Re-querying here would undo that and re-introduce the
  # N+1 the single load exists to prevent.

  #
  # A multi-week contest is played on ONE Slate that holds several games per team
  # (see Nfl::BuildSpanSlate) — NOT on a set of weekly slates joined to the
  # contest. That earlier shape is what forced the span multiplier to be
  # recomputed live across slates, and a live multiplier drifted between pick
  # time and settlement (measured 1.0x -> 3.0x). Now the slate stores a frozen
  # per-team turf_score at rank time and everything reads it.
  #
  # `slate_id` therefore stays a plain scalar FK, and picks_required, locking,
  # assert_enterable!, and Game#score_affected_contests! are all unchanged.

  # WHO GETS THE MONEY, read off the program rather than off sibling prose —
  # this comment has been wrong before. cancel_contest's ONLY token transfer
  # moves the prize-pool PDA's full live balance to the CREATOR's ATA
  # (turf_vault cancel_contest.rs; the destination is constrained
  # `token::authority == contest.creator`). The creator funded that pool at
  # create_contest, so cancelling returns it to them.
  # Rails side: Solana::Vault#build_cancel_contest (vault.rb:1141).
  #
  # ENTRANTS ARE NOT REFUNDED BY THIS FLOW, and entries are not what moves.
  # Entry fees never reach the prize pool at all — enter_contest transfers the
  # user's ATA straight to the operator-revenue ATA — so there is no entrant
  # money in the account cancel drains, and no instruction pays an entrant back.
  # Compensation is a manual mint_entry_token goodwill playbook with no code
  # path (docs/workflows/submit-entry-decision-tree.md row 7); Terms promise an
  # entry-fee refund only for a contest cancelled BEFORE it locks, on request by
  # email (pages/terms.html.erb #refunds). So an entrant looking at "Cancelled"
  # may still be owed something — see ContestsHelper#contest_live_state.
