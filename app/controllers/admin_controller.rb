  # Named modal FLOWS — an ordered sequence a real user walks, as opposed to
  # MODAL_VARIANTS below, which is a flat catalogue of individual states.
  #
  # A flow exists because the interesting bug in a multi-step experience is the
  # ORDER, and a catalogue cannot show order: reviewing "first name" and "age
  # gate" as two unrelated tiles tells you nothing about which one a new user
  # meets first, or what happens when they skip. Each step names a variant key
  # from MODAL_VARIANTS, so the two stay in one registry and the gallery can
  # deep-link a step without duplicating its props.
  #
  # These two mirror OnboardingFlow::STEPS exactly — that service decides the
  # order at runtime, this decides how it is PRESENTED, and
  # test/controllers/onboarding_flow_gallery_test.rb pins them to each other so
  # a step added to the chain cannot go unshown here.
  #
  # DEPRECATED AS A DESTINATION (operator direction, 2026-08-21). Modal PRIMITIVE
  # work goes to the engine's living style guide at /admin/style#modals from now
  # on; a modal built there is inherited by every Studio app, one built here is
  # turf's alone. This registry is not deleted yet for a measured reason rather
  # than an unmade decision: 5 of the modal ids below have no card in the engine
  # guide (wallet-setup, wallet-changed, cdp-ramp, buy-entry-token,
  # cosign-rejected), so
  # deleting this page today would drop their only review surface instead of
  # tidying a duplicate. Port first, delete second.
  #
  # A NAME LEAVES THIS LIST FOR ONE OF TWO REASONS. Either the engine now OWNS
  # the partial and shows its states (a true port), or this page was never that
  # modal's review surface to begin with. An engine SPECIMEN of a card turf
  # still owns is NEITHER — it does not review turf's partial — so a matching
  # id in the engine guide is not on its own grounds to strike a name here.
  # web3-step-up came off on 2026-08-24 by the first route: the engine owns the
  # partial AND shows both of its states, so its cards here were the duplicate,
  # not the review surface. quest-success, unsubscribe-confirm and
  # unsubscribe-goodbye came off on 2026-09-06 by the SECOND
  # (/tasks/drop-dead-gallery-cards): they were registered in
  # layouts/application but never in layouts/modal_preview, so each drew an
  # EMPTY card here and this page was never their showroom.
  # cosign-rejected STAYS — modals/_host_extras registers it once and the
  # engine host renders that on every path, so it really does draw here. The page itself carries the
  # same notice at the top, where someone about to build here will actually see
  # it — see app/views/admin/modals.html.erb.

  #
  # THE REGISTRATION THAT DECIDES WHETHER A CARD DRAWS IS THE PREVIEW
  # LAYOUT'S, NOT THE APP LAYOUT'S. app/views/admin/modal_preview.html.erb
  # has no dynamic fallback — it only calls `modals.open(cfg.id, props)` —
  # so a variant whose :modal_id is missing from
  # app/views/layouts/modal_preview.html.erb opens an EMPTY card here, and
  # empty reads exactly like a modal that simply has little in it. Six cards
  # sat broken that way until /tasks/drop-dead-gallery-cards removed them.
  # modal_gallery_manifest_test.rb now fails the build on a repeat, so add
  # the preview registration in the SAME change as the card.
  #
  # Keep this in sync with app/views/modals/* and with BOTH host registration
  # lists: layouts/application.html.erb (the live app) and
  # layouts/modal_preview.html.erb (this gallery).

    # components/_user_nav.html.erb and layouts/_navbar.html.erb both open this
    # modal with { step, mode, submitting, formError, phantomError, googleError },
    # and the gallery must pass what production passes or it reviews a fiction.
    #
    # `submitting: nil` is deliberate and is NOT the same as leaving the key
    # out. Alpine's x-bind rewrites an `undefined` result to "" whenever the
    # bound expression contains a dot (alpine.js 3.16.1, vendored in
    # studio-engine). "" then misses bindAttribute's [null, undefined, false]
    # removal test, and `disabled` is a boolean attribute, so Alpine SETS
    # disabled="disabled" — an omitted key painted a dead Google/Solana/email
    # card. An explicit nil takes the removal branch instead.
    #
    # The four credential controls are now HARDENED (`!!props.submitting`), so
    # the gallery no longer depends on this key to render live. It stays anyway,
    # and the test below still enforces it: the variant's job is to mirror the
    # live call sites key-for-key, and a preview that drifts from production
    # reviews a different app than the one that ships. Hardening fixed the
    # rendering; it did not remove the reason to mirror.
    # See docs/UI_PATTERNS.md § "Alpine + ERB Constraints" item 10.
