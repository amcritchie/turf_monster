  # WRITE-AHEAD, THEN BROADCAST, THEN PROMOTE. The order of the two writes in

  #
  #   1. save the row   status `pending`, carrying the derived PDA
  #   2. broadcast      the creator's prize-pool USDC moves into the vault
  #   3. stamp          the signature, before anything that can raise
  #   4. verify         the read-back (OPSEC-010)
  #   5. promote        status `open`
  #   6. attach         the banner, last, and unable to fail the request
  #
  # This mirrors the ENTRY path, which has written ahead since 2026-06-05: the
  # row is created first, then the broadcast, then the signature is stamped on
  # it (see #confirm_onchain_entry and the note at :675 — "a strand is then a
  # recoverable row"). The Phantom CONTEST path was the last money path without
  # that property, and it is the one where the USER's money moves.
  #
  # WHY IT MATTERS. Every step from 2 onward can raise, and every raise lands in
  # the `rescue StandardError` below, which tells the user their contest failed.
  # Before this change the row was written at the END, so that message was a lie
  # whenever the broadcast had already succeeded: the prize pool was in the
  # vault and NOTHING outside the request knew — `tx_signature` was a local
  # variable, and Entries::OnchainReconciler is rooted in Contest rows, so a
  # funded PDA with no row is unreachable, not merely unreconciled.
  #
  # The failure mode now INVERTS. A crash leaves a row with no money (sweepable:
  # read the PDA, promote if funded, delete if not) instead of money with no row.

  # It was a per-entry admin button that called `vault.transfer_spl` from
  # admin's USDC ATA → user's ATA. Combined with `Contest#grade!` ->
  # `settle_onchain!` (which already transfers prize-pool USDC to winners via
  # the 2-of-3 settle_contest cosign flow), the two paths together produced a
  # **double payout**: settle pays the winner on-chain, then admin pays again.
  #
  # The single source of truth for payouts is now on-chain settle. After
  # cosign confirms, winners receive USDC in their own ATA. No admin per-entry
  # button.

  # `expected_entry_pda:` — the live path passes the client-supplied PDA to
  #   cross-check (mismatch raises, matching the prior inline guard); the
  #   recovery path omits it (default `false` = skip the cross-check) since it
  #   has no trustworthy client PDA — re-deriving is the whole point. A real
  #   PDA is always a non-empty base58 string, so `false` is an unambiguous
  #   "not provided" sentinel.
  # `entry_token_pda:` — the EntryTokenAccount #prepare_entry chose for this
  #   entry, read back from the PendingTransaction (never the client). Present
  #   means the broadcast must prove an `enter_contest_with_token`; absent, the
  #   `enter_contest` transfer. Verifying the WRONG instruction name would accept
  #   a signature that never moved the funding this entry was priced with.
  # `vault:` — lets a caller reuse an already-instantiated Solana::Vault.
  # The EntryTokenAccount #prepare_entry recorded for this attempt, or nil when it
  # prepared a currency transfer. The PendingTransaction is the server's own note
  # to itself, so this is the one trustworthy answer to "what funding did we
  # price this entry with" at cosign / verify / recover time. A row from before
  # this task carries no `funding` key at all, and reads nil — the USDC path,
  # which is exactly what those attempts were.
  # SHAPE NOTE: `metadata` is a jsonb column that every writer here fills with
  # `.to_json`, so Postgres holds a JSON *string* scalar and reads come back as a
  # String, not a Hash (this is why PendingTransaction#parsed_metadata parses at
  # all). Accept both rather than betting on one — a row written as a real object
  # would otherwise raise TypeError inside the entry's confirm path.
