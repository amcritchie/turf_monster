  # THE WALLET THIS SESSION IS SIGNED IN WITH, and what to paint for it.
  #
  # A value object over one session key, so every surface that shows the current
  # wallet — avatar, colour, name — reads the same answer from the same place
  # instead of each re-deriving it from the user row.
  #
  # WHY SESSION AND NOT THE USER COLUMN, which is the distinction that decides
  # this whole class. `User#web3_wallet_provider` is a DURABLE record of which
  # brand an account last authenticated with; it survives logout on purpose,
  # because it is how the app knows which wallet to offer a returning user. This
  # is the narrower, per-session fact: which wallet is signed in RIGHT NOW. They
  # answer different questions, and conflating them would mean either a logged-out
  # browser still claiming a current wallet, or the account forgetting its brand
  # every time someone signs out.
  #
  # THE BOOKENDS, and why they sit exactly where they do. The session key is
  # written and cleared alongside `:onchain`, which is the same shape of fact (a
  # privilege granted by a live wallet signature) and therefore already has the
  # three seams right:
  #
  #   ApplicationController#set_app_session   -> CLEARED. Every login starts with
  #     no current wallet, so a Phantom session cannot leak its brand into a later
  #     email or Google login on the same browser.
  #   ApplicationController#promote_to_onchain_session! -> SET. Every path that
  #     proves a wallet by signature calls it: SolanaSessionsController#verify
  #     (wallet LOGIN, which also covers a wallet SWITCH, since a switch re-auths
  #     through the same endpoint) and AccountsController#link_solana (wallet
  #     LINK, both its plain and merge branches). It used to say "verify is the
  #     only path", and link_solana quietly was not one — a Google account that
  #     linked Phantom kept a brandless :web2 session it could not enter with.
  #   ApplicationController#clear_app_session -> CLEARED, on logout.
  #
  # An unknown or absent brand is not an error. It resolves to WalletProvider's
  # DEFAULT row, so callers always get an avatar and a colour and never have to
  # branch on nil.
