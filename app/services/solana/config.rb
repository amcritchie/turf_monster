    # This was the last fail-open Solana var — `ENV.fetch("SOLANA_RPC_URL",

    # NETWORK=mainnet-beta with the RPC unset: PROGRAM_ID and the mints resolve
    # to MAINNET values and are then pointed at a DEVNET endpoint. Balances read
    # $0.00 against ATAs that live on the other cluster, and anything submitted
    # lands on devnet against a program ID that does not exist there. That is the
    # SHAPE of the harm the default allows — not what an unset var produces on
    # this app today, because OPSEC-039 does catch that exact pair whenever the
    # RPC answers (see below). What this raise buys is an UNCONDITIONAL refusal,
    # earlier, naming the variable — not the only refusal.
    #
    # IS THIS REDUNDANT WITH OPSEC-039? No — it is additive, on three counts.
    # config/initializers/solana_network_alignment.rb does compare genesis
    # hashes and does catch that exact pair, but only when it runs and only when
    # the RPC answers:
    #   1. Its probe `rescue StandardError` -> logs ERROR "alignment check
    #      INCONCLUSIVE … continuing boot" -> CONTINUES BOOT, deliberately (see
    #      survive-unauthorized-rpc-boot in that file). Only a DETERMINATE
    #      mismatch is fatal, so every indeterminate outcome — timeout, refused
    #      connection, DNS failure, 401/403, a rate limit (which the public
    #      devnet URL earns under load), a non-JSON error page — silences the one
    #      check meant to catch this. That rescue named `Solana::Client::RpcError`
    #      when this paragraph was written; widening it made the fail-open window
    #      WIDER, not narrower.
    #   2. An unknown NETWORK has no canonical genesis, so the guard logs
    #      "skipping alignment check" and boots. On `turf-monster-mainnet` that
    #      outcome is not reachable on its own: NETWORK also keys IDL_PATH, so an
    #      unrecognized value selects the DEVNET IDL and the OPSEC-014 hash guard
    #      — an earlier `after_initialize` — refuses boot first, as an opaque
    #      hash diff rather than a named variable.
    #   3. `SOLANA_SKIP_NETWORK_CHECK=true` disables it wholesale — set during
    #      incident response and forgotten, it leaves nothing behind it.
    # And when it does fire it fires from `after_initialize`, AFTER eager load,
    # as a genesis-hash diff whose remediation line guesses at the variable.
    # This raise fires during eager load and names it.

    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # THE BUG THIS CLOSES (redact-helius-key-from-browser). Six surfaces
    # emitted `RPC_URL` verbatim into the response body — `body[data-solana-
    # rpc-url]` in both layouts, `#cosign-config[data-rpc-url]` on the three
    # admin cosign pages, and `@page_config[:rpc_url]` on the PUBLIC
    # proof-of-reserves page, which additionally renders it as visible text.
    # On `turf-monster-mainnet` that constant is a Helius endpoint carrying an
    # `api-key` query param, so every page load shipped a paid-provider
    # credential to every browser, logged in or not.
    #
    # The codebase already knew the constant was secret-bearing: the
    # `solana:health` / `solana:preflight` rakes redact it before printing to a
    # TERMINAL (they now share `redact_rpc_url` below). The DOM was the one
    # place that did not.
    #
    # WHY A SEPARATE ENDPOINT RATHER THAN A PROXY. The client signs and submits
    # its own transactions (Phantom -> `sendRawTransaction`) and polls
    # `getSignatureStatuses` directly (see app/javascript/solana_utils.js);
    # proxying all of that through Rails would put an availability-critical
    # JSON-RPC relay in the request path for a problem an env var solves. So
    # the server keeps its keyed endpoint and the browser gets its own.

    #   Solana::Client::InsecureRpcUrlError — the gem interpolates
    #     `#{@rpc_url.inspect}` (a fat-fingered `http://` scheme is the most
    #     likely operator error during a rotation, and it prints the key).
    #   URI::InvalidURIError — quotes the offending URI back at you.
    #
    # Both were interpolated raw into the boot guard's ERROR line and into
    # `solana:health` output, beside a second half that redacted correctly.
    #
    # Two passes, because neither alone is sufficient:
    #   1. Every http(s)-ish substring goes through `redact_rpc_url`, so a URL
    #      from ANY source (an upstream's error body, a redirect target) is
    #      masked by the same rules the rest of the app uses.
    #   2. The credential-bearing parts of the CONFIGURED endpoint are masked
    #      literally. Pass 1 only fires on something that parses as a URL; a
    #      mangled endpoint ("https:// host/?api-key=…", a stray newline) can
    #      strand the key outside any parseable URL, and that is exactly the
    #      malformed input this path exists to diagnose.
    #
    # `scrub` FIRST, for the same reason the boot guard does (see
    # config/initializers/solana_network_alignment.rb): `gsub` on a string with
    # invalid UTF-8 raises ArgumentError from inside the rescue clause that

    #      domain-restricted provider key, or a paid public tier).
    #   2. `RPC_URL`, when it carries no credential. This is what keeps dev,
    #      test and QA byte-identical: their RPC_URL is the public devnet
    #      endpoint, so the browser receives exactly what it received before.
    #   3. The cluster's canonical public endpoint.
    #
    # Step 1 is CHECKED, not trusted. A credential pasted into
    # SOLANA_PUBLIC_RPC_URL by mistake is DROPPED (and logged, redacted)
    # instead of served — the guard has to bite at the emission, not rely on
    # the operator having remembered. That is the difference between this and

    # NOT CHECKED: that the public endpoint names the same CLUSTER as
    # SOLANA_RPC_URL. Verifying that means a genesis-hash RPC round trip, which
    # is the OPSEC-039 initializer's job (config/initializers/
    # solana_network_alignment.rb) and does not belong on a render path. The

    # SOLANA_PUBLIC_RPC_URL can, so set it per app, not per fleet.

    # on absence. A garbage value fails closed (it is not "mainnet-beta", so the
    # devnet-only guards below and in the controllers all refuse), but an UNSET
    # var silently resolved to "devnet" on a mainnet app.
    #
    # WHAT THAT ACTUALLY REACHED — corrected 2026-08-20. The first version of
    # this comment claimed an unset var would have silently selected the DEVNET
    # MINTS on a mainnet app, citing the §8 footgun documented below. The
    # MECHANISM is real (USDC_MINT / USDT_MINT key their DEFAULTS on NETWORK)
    # but that outcome was NOT REACHABLE: `turf-monster-mainnet` sets
    # SOLANA_USDC_MINT and SOLANA_USDT_MINT explicitly, and the env override
    # always wins, so it needed THREE unset vars, not one. The claim was written
    # without reading the live config that disproves it. It is corrected here
    # rather than quietly dropped, because a comment left standing gets cited as
    # established history.
    #
    # The honest case is IDL_PATH and LEGIBILITY. NETWORK also keys IDL_PATH
    # (below), so an unset var on the mainnet app selects the DEVNET IDL, whose
    # SHA256 is not in that app's EXPECTED_IDL_HASH. The boot is then refused —
    # by the OPSEC-014 guard as an opaque hash diff, or by the OPSEC-039
    # alignment guard as a genesis diff whose remediation line names the WRONG
    # variable ("likely SOLANA_RPC_URL"). Both are `after_initialize`; this
    # raise fires during EAGER LOAD, before either of them, so the operator
    # reads the name of the variable instead of two hashes.
    #
    # Next in line behind that: `Solana::Config.devnet?` reads this constant, so
    # an unset var re-arms the OPSEC-020 fund guards — reachable only once the
    # IDL guard ahead of it is bypassed (BYPASS_IDL_CHECK, a documented escape
    # hatch), which is exactly the situation in which nobody wants a second

    # was wrong. Admin::VaultInitController and `solana:init_vault` each fell
    # back to the DEVNET literal on every cluster — and because the variable is
    # ABSENT on both deployed apps, that fallback is what actually ran, so a
    # mainnet build offered the DEVNET Squad. The controller additionally used
    # `ENV.fetch`, which does not fall back at all for an EMPTY value; that
    # second defect was LATENT (one `heroku config:set VAR=` from live), never
    # the observed production behaviour. Both readers were routed through this
    # method by vault-pda-readers-diverge; the guard in
    # test/integration/contract_upgrade_authority_test.rb now covers Ruby and
    # rake as well as ERB, so a third reader cannot reintroduce a literal.
    #
    # WHAT THE DEPLOYED APPS ACTUALLY DO. Neither sets this variable — the key
    # SOLANA_SQUADS_VAULT_PDA is ABSENT from the config of turf-monster-mainnet
    # and turf-monster-qa alike, re-verified 2026-09-05 by KEY PRESENCE
    # (`heroku config --json -a <app>` does not carry the key, and the table
    # view — which names every key regardless of value — names it zero times).
    # ABSENT, not set-and-empty. So the NETWORK-keyed DEFAULT below is the
    # production path on both clusters, SOLANA_NETWORK is what actually selects
    # the authority (mainnet-beta on the mainnet app, devnet on QA — both
    # present and non-empty), and the env override is the runbook escape hatch.
    #
    # DO NOT VERIFY THIS WITH `heroku config:get`. It prints a bare newline for
    # an ABSENT key and a bare newline for a PRESENT-BUT-EMPTY one, so it
    # cannot tell the two apart. Reading its output as "empty" is exactly how
    # this comment once carried a false production fact into review.
    #
    # `.presence` therefore guards a LATENT case rather than the live one: a
    # single `heroku config:set SOLANA_SQUADS_VAULT_PDA=` would make the key
    # present-and-empty, which `ENV.fetch(k, default)` would resolve to "".
    #
    # A METHOD, not a constant, for exactly the reason `public_rpc_url` is one:
    # the resolution has to be exercisable across BOTH clusters without constant
    # surgery. The `network` argument exists for the tests; nothing in app code
    # passes it.
    #
    # Resolution mirrors USDC_MINT / IDL_PATH: the env override always wins, and
    # only the DEFAULT is network-keyed, so a mainnet app cannot print a devnet
    # authority by omission. `.presence` (as in `solana:init_vault`) so an empty
    # `heroku config:set SOLANA_SQUADS_VAULT_PDA=` falls through to the cluster
    # default instead of rendering a blank authority. An UNRECOGNISED cluster
    # gets the devnet default — never mainnet's — because the failure that
    # matters is claiming mainnet authority somewhere it does not apply.

    # IDL hash pinning (audit Tier 3 #22). Catches drift between the Rails
    # app's expected program shape and what's actually deployed on-chain.
    # Workflow:
    #   1. Operator runs `bin/rails solana:verify_idl` (or `anchor idl fetch`)
    #      to download the deployed IDL into config/turf_vault.idl.json
    #   2. Operator runs `bin/rails solana:idl_hash` to print the SHA256
    #   3. Set EXPECTED_IDL_HASH below (or in env) to that value
    #   4. On every boot (production only), the initializer compares the
    #      committed IDL's hash against EXPECTED_IDL_HASH. Mismatch raises.
    #
    # IDL_PATH points at the committed IDL JSON. The file is hand-maintained
    # — updated when turf_vault deploys a new version.
    #
    # Network-keyed (mainnet launch): the devnet and mainnet IDLs are
    # byte-identical EXCEPT the `address` field (the program ID), which makes
    # their SHA256 differ. Each cluster therefore commits its own IDL file and
    # pins its own EXPECTED_IDL_HASH per Heroku app. Selection is by NETWORK so
    # a single source tree boots correctly on either cluster:
    #   - mainnet-beta -> config/turf_vault.mainnet.idl.json (address DaFv…, e13ffd11…)
    #   - anything else (devnet/localnet) -> config/turf_vault.idl.json (address EQGF…, c2acccaa…)
    # (hashes churn per turf-vault rev — `bin/rails solana:idl_hash` for the live value)
    # The devnet branch is byte-identical to the prior unconditional path, so
    # the live devnet-prod app's verify_idl!/precompile behavior is unchanged.

    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    # THE ONLY SANCTIONED WAY TO BUILD A SERVER-SIDE Solana::Client.
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # THE BUG THIS CLOSES (route-solana-clients-through-config). Six call
    # sites wrote `Solana::Client.new` with no argument. The gem's own
    # initializer then resolves the endpoint itself:
    #
    #   @rpc_url = rpc_url || ENV.fetch("SOLANA_RPC_URL", DEFAULT_RPC_URL)
    #
    # — and `DEFAULT_RPC_URL` is the PUBLIC DEVNET endpoint. So every guard
    # this module owns was skipped on those paths:
    #
    #   * OPSEC-012's production-required raise. `RPC_URL` above refuses to
    #     resolve at all when SOLANA_RPC_URL is unset in production; the gem
    #     FAILS OPEN to devnet instead. The two disagree in the exact
    #     direction that hurts — a mainnet app whose RPC var went missing
    #     keeps serving, silently reading and writing against devnet, with
    #     mainnet PROGRAM_ID and mainnet mints.
    #   * The public/credentialed split and `redact_rpc_url` (PR 390). A
    #     client the module never handed out is outside the decision about
    #     which endpoint is safe and how it is rendered in logs.
    #
    # Passing `rpc_url:` explicitly is still legitimate — the network-alignment
    # initializer and the health rake both do it — but the value has to come
    # from THIS module. `test/services/solana/client_routed_through_config_test.rb`
    # enforces both halves of that rule against the source tree, because the
    # `.erb` / `app/javascript` ban PR 390 added does not reach Ruby.
    #
    # NOT a memoized singleton: `Solana::Client` holds a parsed URI and a
    # request counter, is used from Sidekiq workers and web threads alike, and
    # is cheap to build. Per-call construction keeps the previous lifetime.
