# Converge stranded `pending` Contest rows against the chain.
#
# WHAT STRANDS ONE. ContestsController#finalize writes the Contest row FIRST
# (`status: :pending`, carrying the derived PDA), broadcasts `create_contest`,
# stamps the returned signature, verifies the transaction, and only then
# promotes the row to `open`. That ordering (PR #551) inverted the failure mode
# on purpose: a crash used to leave MONEY WITH NO ROW, which no reconciler could
# reach because Entries::OnchainReconciler is rooted in Contest rows; it now
# leaves A ROW WITH NO MONEY, which is sweepable. This service is the sweep.
# Until it existed, "sweepable" was a property nothing exercised.
#
# THE DECISION, and why it is existence and not a balance:
#
#   PDA PRESENT  → PROMOTE to `open`. `create_contest` is ONE instruction and
#     Solana applies it atomically: turf-vault's create_contest.rs `init`s the
#     Contest PDA, `init`s the per-contest prize_pool token account, and CPIs
#     the creator's USDC transfer into it, all in the same handler. There is no
#     interleaving in which the account exists but the transfer did not run, so
#     the account existing IS the funding proof.
#
#     This is also why "and is funded" must NOT be re-tested as `prize_pool > 0`.
#     create_contest's validation #5 requires `any_fee_set || prize_pool > 0` —
#     a fee-charging contest with a ZERO prize pool is legal on chain. Gating the
#     promote on a positive pool would delete a real, funded, entry-taking
#     contest and strand its PDA exactly the way PR #551 set out to prevent.
#     The pool is read for the log line as evidence, never as a gate.
#
#   PDA ABSENT   → DELETE the row. The broadcast never landed, so no lamport
#     moved and nothing on chain refers to this slug. The row is pure squat: it
#     holds a uniquely-indexed slug its creator cannot reuse, and it is the only
#     thing standing between that creator and a clean retry.
#
#   PDA UNKNOWN  → LEAVE IT. An RPC fault is not evidence of absence. This is
#     the one place this service deliberately differs from
#     Entries::OnchainReconciler#onchain_account_exists?, which folds an RPC
#     error into "absent" — safe there, because the consequence is a SKIP. Here
#     the absent branch DELETES, so folding an error into it would let a rate
#     limit destroy a funded contest's only row. Errors skip; the next sweep
#     asks again.
#
#   UNRESOLVABLE → FLAG. Two rows must never be auto-deleted even with an absent
#     PDA: one whose stored `onchain_contest_id` does not match the PDA derived
#     from its slug (the identity is broken, so "absent" describes an address we
#     cannot attribute to this row), and one carrying an `onchain_tx_signature`
#     (something recorded a landed broadcast; a human reads the chain, not a
#     sweeper). Flagged rows are stamped `onchain_reconcile_flagged_at`, alert
#     once, and are then left alone.
#
# GUARDRAIL — READ-ONLY ON CHAIN. This service never signs, never broadcasts,
# never transfers, and never calls create_contest. It reads account state and
# writes Rails rows. Mirrors Deposits::OnchainReconciler (service + thin job +
# sidekiq-cron entry).

    # would broadcast against a row that no longer exists.
    #
    # PROMOTING a live one is harmless by contrast — finalize's own STEP 5
    # `update!(status: :open)` is then a no-op — but the same threshold gates
    # both, because a row this young has nothing to gain from either verdict.
