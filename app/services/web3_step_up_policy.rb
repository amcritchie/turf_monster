# frozen_string_literal: true

# Does THIS SESSION owe a wallet signature before it is really the user it says?
#
# The situation this names: an account secured by a self-custody wallet signs in
# with email or Google. Both facts are true at once and neither is wrong —
# the account holds a Phantom-class wallet (an identity fact), and the session
# was established by a web2 credential (a session fact). studio-engine's
# SessionContext has modelled that intersection since it was lifted out of this
# app — `web2?` AND `phantom_linked?` — but nothing ever acted on it, so a wallet
# owner arriving by magic link was logged straight in with no web3 beat at all.
# This policy is the missing verdict; SessionContext stays the state.
#
# The rule, in order:
#   1. No user                 -> NO. A guest owes nothing; they owe a login.
#   2. Session already :web3   -> NO. They signed THIS session (onchain_session?),
#                                 which is the very thing a step-up asks for.
#   3. No self-custody wallet  -> NO. A managed/web2-only account is fully
#                                 served by the session it just established.
#      Note this is deliberately NOT the same question WalletSetupPolicy asks.
#      That one asks "should this account GET a wallet?"; this one asks "should
#      this SESSION prove the wallet it already has?" — opposite populations,
#      which is why a user can never be shown both (a phantom_wallet? account
#      exits WalletSetupPolicy at its own step 1).
#   4. Otherwise               -> YES.
#
# ADVISORY, NOT AN ENFORCEMENT BOUNDARY (operator call, 2026-08-21). A `true`
# here opens a DISMISSIBLE modal; it does not suspend the session. The teeth are
# where they already were — ContestsController#enter refuses a web3 session
# OUTRIGHT (routing it to prepare_entry -> confirm_onchain_entry, where the
# signed transaction is the proof), and every on-chain path still demands a live
# signature — so this moves
# the PROMPT to sign-in without moving any gate, exactly the way the age gate's
# prompt moved to onboarding while its enforcement stayed at entry. Getting this
# backwards would lock a legitimate owner out of their own account over a
# wallet they merely cannot reach right now.
#
# ONE CALLER READS THIS AS A GATE, and the difference is worth naming because it
# reads like a contradiction and is not. ContestsController#enter refuses a PAID
# on-chain entry when this policy says `true` AND the account holds no custodial
# keypair — not because the advice became enforcement, but because such an
# account has nothing to sign the entry with, so proceeding could only fail.
# The refusal is scoped by that second fact: a COMBO account gets the same
# `true` here and enters anyway, from the wallet the server holds. Everywhere
# else the verdict still only opens a card. (2026-09-07 — a player met the
# unguarded path as a raw exception string; the guard is the correction.)
#
# NO I/O. Unlike WalletSetupPolicy (which reads a balance), every input here is a
# column or a session flag, so this is safe on the render path and costs nothing
# to ask twice.

  # `session_mode` is SessionContext#mode — :guest / :web2 / :web3. Taking the

  # "this must be web2 because of which controller I am in". Two auth paths call
  # this and BOTH were web2-by-construction when it was written; that is precisely
